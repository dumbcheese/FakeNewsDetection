Obama  Well  I will be  supporting the filibuster because I think Judge Alito  in fact  is  somebody who is contrary to core American values  not just liberal  values  you know When you look at his decisions in particular during  times of war  we need a court that is independent and is going to  provide some check on the executive branch  and he has not shown himself  willing to do that repeatedly I will say this  though  I think that  the Democrats have to do a much better job in making their case on these  issues These last minute efforts using procedural maneuvers inside the  Beltway  I think  has been the wrong way of going about it  and we need  to recognize  because Judge Alito will be confirmed  that if were  going to oppose a nominee that weve got to persuade the American people  that  in fact  their values are at stake and frankly Im not sure that  weve successfully done that Stephanopoulos  Well  it sounds  to me like youre not really happy about going forward and joining this  filibuster And Ive actually seen some reports that inside the  Democratic caucus you were arguing against this strategy Is that true? Obama   Well  you know  I dont talk about what I  you know  what takes place  in caucus but what I will say is that there is an over reliance on the  part of Democrats for procedural maneuvers and mechanisms to block the  president instead of proactively going out to the American people and  talking about the values that we care about And  you know  theres one  way to guarantee that the judges who are appointed to the Supreme Court  are judges that reflect our values and thats to win elections Later  that day  a report from the Associated Press carried the headline   Sen Obama Criticizes Filibuster Tactic The next day   Democrats failed in their attempt to filibuster on a vote of 72 to 25   with Obama  joining 24 other Democrats on the losing end Obama may  have criticized the filibuster even as he joined it  but at the end of  the day  he still joined it Kyl said  President Obama himself  attempted to filibuster Justice Alito  who now sits on the Supreme  Court,2,0,678,real

Since Hawaii  wasnt incorporated as a state until 1959  there isnt a lot of history  to examine And since Hawaii has just four members of Congress  two  senators and two members of the US House   there are relatively few  elections to scour In fact  only 5 people have represented the  state in the US Senate  the two sitting senators  Democrats Daniel  Inouye and Daniel Akaka  and three others    Republican Hiram Fong   Democrat Spark Matsunaga and Democrat Oren E Long None of them lost a  re election campaign for the Senate    Fong and Long retired and  Matsunaga died in office Hawaiis two congressional House  districts were created in 1971 Previously both seats had been elected  at large Djou will represent Hawaiis 1st District  the second  Republican ever to do so He replaces Abercrombie  a 10 term  Democrat who resigned to run for governor The states 2nd District has  never elected a Republican Have any incumbents lost? Not  really In the 2nd District  Patsy Mink  Daniel Akaka and Ed Case  all resigned or retired in order to run for another office Mink was  eventually re elected to the US House and died in office In  the 1st District  Spark Matsunaga  Cecil Heftel  Pat Saiki and  Abercrombie all also resigned to run for another office Theres  one asterisk Abercrombie was first elected to Congress in 1986 in a  special election just like Djou But though he won the special election   he lost his partys primary to run for a full  two year term on the  very same day We counted and found about 50 elections where the  incumbent on Hawaii was on the ballot The closest anyone got to losing  was Abercrombie in 1986  but he wasnt actually an incumbent when he  lost the Democratic primary Depending how you count it  that  puts the re election rate in Hawaii between 98 percent and 100 percent   which is higher than the national average over the same period Though  Steele was talking about federal races  we also checked to see if an  incumbent Hawaii governor ever lost a bid for re election It happened  once since Hawaii became a state  in 1962  when Republican William Quinn  lost to Democrat John Burns Back to the statement by RNC  Chairman Steele He said Hawaiians dont have a history of  throwing incumbents out of office and said that Djous election  to Congress in May means Republicans have a good shot of keeping the  seat in November While were not in the business of predicting the  outcome of House races  no incumbent has ever lost a November  congressional election in Hawaii,2,0,716,real

1576,2010-03-12T11:45:14-05:00,2010,wwwyoutubecom,Americas Health Insurance Plans,Health insurance companies costs are only 4 percent of all health care spending,As the battle over health care reform approaches a climax  Americas Health Insurance Plans    the trade group for the private health insurance industry    began airing a new ad highlighting statistics on what actually goes into the nations health care spending Heres the full text of AHIPs ad  Whats inside the health care cost pie? Some in Washington say its all health insurance But health care insurance is one of the smallest slices Health insurance companies costs are only 4 percent of all health care spending Doctors  hospitals  medicines and tests are the biggest slices  and a government report says their rising prices are the primary driver of higher health care costs If Washington wants to make health care more affordable  they need to look at the whole health care pie  not just a slice This ad touches on a bunch of controversial and complex issues in just 30 seconds But for our fact check  well focus on a narrow question  Is AHIP correct when it says that health insurance companies costs amount to only 4 percent of all health care spending? We looked at data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  a part of the federal Department of Health and Human Services Every year  CMSs Office of the Actuary produces statistics on national health expenditures and the items that make up those purchases Thats the source that AHIP cited in the ad  and one thats considered credible by independent experts The full breakdown for 2008 is posted on the CMS Web site Well recap the data here In 2008  total national health expenditures in the United States    the combination of money spent by consumers out of pocket  by private insurers and by local  state and federal governments    exceeded  23 trillion Of that   92 billion went for the cost of private health insurance Cost in this case refers to overhead and profits    not to any of the dollars that are funneled through insurers accounts on behalf of their patients It also excludes any overhead by government run insurers such as CMS itself  which signs the checks for Medicare and Medicaid If you divide private insurance costs by total expenditures  it works out to 39 percent    almost exactly what AHIP said For comparisons sake  hospitals accounted for 307 percent of spending  professional services  including doctors  nurses  dentists and other clinical services  accounted for 313 percent  and retail sales of drugs and other medical products accounted for 128 percent To see whether the figures for 2009 changed the equation much  we checked in with John A Poisal  deputy director of national health statistics in the CMS actuarys office He said the updated but not yet posted numbers were nearly  25 trillion in total expenditures and  902 billion in insurance costs That works out to 36 percent Rounded up  thats once again as AHIP portrayed it Next  we scrutinized the total health expenditure figure In addition to including such factors as doctors  hospitals and medicines  this amount includes dollars spent on nursing homes and home health care  governmental public health activities  medical research  and medical related construction projects Since these items are somewhat extraneous to the costs that AHIP is discussing in its ad  we decided to run the numbers without these factors included For 2008  insurance costs divided by health expenditures other than those removed above amounted to 48 percent Even when rounded up  5 percent is close to the 4 percent AHIP cited  and its a percentage far below what hospitals  doctors and pharmaceuticals claimed For 2009  the numbers are much the same  working out to 45 percent We weighed whether it made any sense to divide private insurance costs by total private health insurance expenditures    a number that excludes all expenses paid by the government  by consumers out of their own pockets  and by other private sources  such as foundations When you make that calculation  the answer is 117 percent for 2008 and 111 percent in 2009    almost three times as high as AHIPs cited rate Ultimately  though  we concluded that AHIPs numbers more accurately reflect the question it poses When youre asking what health expenditures could conceivably be trimmed for cost control purposes  theres no reason to exempt Medicare  Medicaid and other non private expenditures from consideration Even if its correct  not everyone in the health policy arena believes that AHIPs calculation is relevant Linda Blumberg  a senior fellow at the Urban Institute  said what we should be looking at is the insurer return to capital  They make a lot of money relative to what they invest  and they do almost nothing for that money to hold down the growth in health care spending Meanwhile  some critics suggest that when AHIP points the finger at doctors and hospitals for health care cost inflation  it ignores its own role Insurers  after all  sign the checks and could presumably use greater leverage to keep costs down However  our conclusion here doesnt argue one way or another on the question of whether private health insurance could be run more efficiently  whether private insurers should take on a bigger or a smaller role in the health care system  or whether more money should be spent for  say  doctors instead of insurance costs We are merely checking whether AHIP provided accurate figures to answer the question it raised And as far as we can tell  the group did,2,0,895,real

Between February 2004 and February 2010  FBI data shows that people on the terrorist watch list  went through the background check process to purchase firearms or explosives  1 225 times  and that 1 116  about 91 percent  of the purchases were allowed to  proceed because no prohibiting information was found such as felony  convictions  illegal immigrant status  those dishonorably discharged from the armed forces or people adjudicated as mentally defective or who have been committed to a mental institution A report  from the US Government Accountability Office shows Bloomberg is right   Membership in a terrorist organization does not prohibit a person from  possessing firearms or explosives under current federal law But that doesnt mean  these purchases go unnoticed by the feds When a person on the Known or Appropriately  Suspected Terrorists list applies to buy a firearm  it sets off notifications  to various law enforcement and counterterrorism intelligence groups  according  to the FBI assistant director Daniel D Roberts testimony before the Senate Committee on Homeland  Security and Governmental Affairs on May 5  2010 In this situation  in  a given investigation  the attempt may  in combination with other factors  lead  to enhanced investigative methods  such as surveillance  Roberts stated What  the attempt to buy a firearm means in a counterterrorism investigation  and as a  result the subsequent actions it warrants  necessarily must be evaluated on a  case by case basis But if no federally prohibitive information is  uncovered  the purchases are allowed to proceed Sen Frank Lautenberg   D NJ  has introduced legislation to close the so called terror gap in the  nations gun laws Under the law  the FBI would be given the latitude to deny  firearms and explosives sales to people on the suspected terrorist lists Anyone  denied a purchase could appeal to the courts to overturn it The bill has the  support of 500 mayors who are members of the bipartisan coalition Mayors Against  Illegal Guns But  its not a slam dunk Some legislators have raised constitutional issues with  the proposal Before we subject innocent Americans who have done  nothing but have the wrong name at the wrong time having to go to court and pay  the cost of going to court to get their gun rights back  I want to slow down and  think about it  Sen Lindsey Graham  R SC  said in the Senate hearing  Theres a difference between losing your rights  based on a felony charge that has been proven in a court of law and appealed and  is a conviction in the books  and being on some list thats at best suspect   Graham said Were talking about a second amendment right   Graham said Some of the people pushing this idea are pushing the idea of  banning handguns And I dont think banning handguns makes me safer Whether the law makes  sense is a political matter But unless or until the proposed law is enacted   there is no dispute that the FBI currently does not have the power to block  suspected terrorists from buying dynamite or an AK 47  as Bloomberg said  unless  they have some other disqualifying factor such as a felony conviction on their  record And  in fact  people on the terror watch list have been able to purchase firearms or explosives more than a thousand times in the past six  years The purchases may trigger enhanced investigative methods from the FBI   but the sales are allowed just the same,1,0,696,real

Elena Kagans top credentials    that she was dean of Harvard Law  School    created some controversy on the day that President Barack  Obama announced her nomination to the US Supreme Court As  dean  Kagan took a lead role in trying to keep military recruiters off  campus because of the Dont Ask  Dont Tell policy that prevents gays  and lesbians from serving openly in the military Several Republicans pointed  to that episode in their initial comments on Kagan  calling the incident  troubling Sen John Barrasso  R Wyo  also pointed out that the  incident put her on the losing side of a Supreme Court ruling At  Harvard Law School  Barrasso said  She took a position and the Supreme  Court ruled unanimously that she was wrong Barrasso said he was  keeping an open mind on the nomination We were interested in  fact checking his statement that the Supreme Court ruled unanimously  that she was wrong The controversy over military recruiters  began even before Kagan became dean of Harvard Law in 2003 Harvard was  one of several top tier law schools that attempted to ban military  recruiters because of the policy that prevented gays and lesbians from  serving openly in the military In 2003  Kagan penned a letter  to the law school community expressing her thoughts on the issue  I  abhor the militarys discriminatory recruitment policy The importance  of the military to our society    and the extraordinary service that  members of the military provide to all the rest of us    makes this  discrimination more  not less  repugnant The militarys policy deprives  many men and women of courage and character from having the opportunity  to serve their country in the greatest way possible This is a profound  wrong    a moral injustice of the first order And it is a wrong that  tears at the fabric of our own community  because some of our members  cannot  while others can  devote their professional careers to their  country Congress threatened to yank federal funding for schools  that banned recruiters through a measure known as the Solomon  Amendment  named for Rep Gerald Solomon  R NY  and first passed in  1996 Schools and recruiters tried to sort out their differences in the  intervening years  with some schools providing partial access But  eventually the issue came before the Supreme Court in 2004 in a case  known as Rumsfeld vs Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights  known  as FAIR FAIR was an association of law schools that opposed the Solomon  Amendment In her role as a professor of law at Havard  Kagan  signed onto an amicus brief  sometimes known as a friend of the court  brief  filed by 40 Harvard professors that argued that the federal  government should not be able to withhold funding if the schools applied  the same policies to all recruiters Harvard  for example  required all  recruiters to sign forms indicating they would not discriminate against  applicants based on sexual orientation The withholding of funds  interfered with the schools freedom of expression to oppose what they  felt were discriminatory policies The Harvard law professors  argued in their brief that this case is not    and has never been     about whether law schools may discriminate against the military or  whether they must provide equal access to military recruiters  Instead  the question is whether the Solomon Amendment confers upon  military recruiters the unprecedented entitlement to disregard neutral  and generally applicable recruiting rules whenever a schools failure to  make a special exception might incidentally hinger or preclude military  recruiting The answer is no The Supreme Court  however   disagreed in an 8 0 ruling on March 6  2006 The majority opinion   written by Chief Justice John Roberts  ruled against FAIR and  in doing  so  rejected the claims of Kagan and the other law professors that the  school had the right to enforce non discrimination policies against the  military Under the statute  military recruiters must be given the same  access as recruiters who comply with the policy  the opinion said The  court also rejected arguments that claimed that the law  schools treatment of military recruiters could be considered expression under the First Amendment If the action  itself were purely expressive  the court reasoned  the schools would  not have to issue statements explaining their actions The court  compared the situation to someone who says he wont pay his income taxes  because he disapproves of the Internal Revenue Service The disapproval  is protected speech  but the non payment of taxes is not The  opinion was supported by Justices John Paul Stevens  Antonin Scalia   Anthony Kennedy  David Souter  Clarence Thomas  Ruth Bader Ginsburg  and  Stephen Breyer joining Roberts Justice Samuel Alito did not  participate because he had not yet been seated to the court when oral  arguments were made Barrasso said Kagan took a position and  the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that she was wrong The court did  reject the arguments put forward by the law schools  which included FAIR  and the brief filed by the Harvard professors All of the justices who  voted opposed the law schools

In fact  much has been made of Stevens religion since he announced his retirement on April 9 Once he steps down    and unless President Barack Obama appoints another Protestant to take his place    there will be no more Protestants on the bench Justice David Souter  who left the court in 2009  is Episcopalian  a religion that combines both Protestant and Catholic traditions He was replaced by Justice Sonia Sotomayor  who is Catholic In addition to Sotomayor  five of the justices are Catholic  including Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr  and Justices Antonin Scalia  Anthony M Kennedy  Clarence Thomas and Samuel A Alito Jr Justices Stephen G Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsberg are Jewish So  why all this discussion of Stevens religious affiliation?

We had to limit our investigation to roll call votes  in the Senate  less controversial bills or amendments are frequently adopted by unanimous consent or by voice vote  meaning members simply say aye or nay First  we turned to   Congressional Quarterly    a publication that annually studies lawmakers voting records According to   CQ  s Web site  Grassley has had a flawless voting record since 1993 The   Washington Post  also compiles similar information  and we found that Grassley hasnt been absent for a vote since he missed four votes on July 14  1993  Those votes pertained to a bill that would allow federal employees to participate in the political process so long as it was done outside of work  What kept Grassley from the Senate floor that day in 1993? Flooding in Iowa  according to the   Des Moines Register  noting that the senator has become the iron man of the Senate racking up  5 700 consecutive votes Indeed  as an average  Grassley has voted about 996 percent of the time since he took office in 1981 Other senators elected at the same time cannot tout such near perfect records For example  Sen Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania has  on average  voted 93 percent of the time in the last 28 years  first as a Republican then as a Democrat And Sen Chris Dodd  a Democrat from Connecticut  has voted on average about 907 percent of the time Grassley has gone to great lengths to maintain his record When  for example  a blizzard threatened Washington  DC  on the eve of a crucial health care overhaul vote on Dec 19  2009  Grassley spent the night in his office to make sure he didnt miss it Bc of potential blizzard Ive come to office to sleep  he Tweeted the night of the 18th Vote at 720am vote Sat Hv not missed vote 7 93 5700 votes consecutive Grassley said he hadnt missed a vote since 1993  which is certainly correct for every recorded vote Grassley has every right to brag We give him a True,2,0,455,real

Our National Debt has gone up by  1 729 000 000 during the Isner v Mahut match We couldnt resist checking his math We first decided that what Buchanan meant by during the Isner v Mahut match was the time between the first serve on June 22  2010  and the final point on June 24  2010 That was roughly 48 hours  or two days One way to look at it is to use the Congressional Budget Offices analysis of the presidents budget  which was released in March This predicts a  1368 trillion deficit for 2010 If you divide this by 365 days  you get an incremental  daily addition to the debt of  3748 billion Over two days  the total is  7496 billion Thats more than four times of Buchanans estimate Another way is to turn to the historical tables for federal debt published by the Office of Management and Budget These tables list the federal debt as it stands every year on Dec 31 We took the debt estimate for the end of 2010   13787 trillion  and subtracted the debt as it stood at the end of 2009   11876 trillion  to determine the amount of debt increase over the course of 2010   1911 trillion  Dividing by 365  you get a daily debt increase of  5234 billion  or  10470 billion over two days Thats about six times more than what Buchanan had said Why so different? We contacted Buchanans office and an aide clarified that what theyd actually meant in the tweet was how much the debt had risen during the 11 hour  5 minute match itself  The match was suspended for darkness twice and there were delays on the third day to give extra rest time  So  using our first method  the 11 hour debt increase works out to  1718 billion  while using the second  its about  24 billion Of these two  the first is spot on Since the size of the federal debt is a moving target  and since economists periodically re evaluate its size  well grant Buchanan leeway here While we think the wording of his tweet suggests the full  48 hour period  his 11 hour number strikes us as a reasonable estimate,2,0,446,real

The monies recouped from the TARP shall be paid into the general fund of the treasury for the reduction of the public debt,President Barack Obama has proposed a boost for small businesses  but Sen Judd Gregg isnt hot on the idea In a hearing about the administrations latest budget  Gregg  a New Hampshire Republican  criticized the White House for proposing to use funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program  an initiative originally intended to keep the banking system from collapsing  to help community banks lend to small businesses Gregg said it violates TARP rules The whole concept of the TARP was that as we recoup the money  and as we recoup that money  we would use it to pay down the debt  Gregg said  responding to Obamas Feb 2  2010  proposal to transfer  30 billion from TARP to a new program that will support small business lending Now thats not going to happen  Its become a piggy bank  The law is very clear! The monies recouped from the TARP shall be paid into the general fund of the Treasury for the reduction of the public debt Peter Orszag  Obamas budget chief  defended the proposal The degree to which shifting funds would add to our debt or deficits depends on what the net subsidy rate would be on that new activity  he told Gregg And remember  the purpose of TARP was to address problems in our financial markets  and it has been remarkably successful in bringing credit spreads back down to normal levels One of the lingering problems in our financial markets  however  is access to credit for small businesses Late in 2009  Obama ran into similar criticism from Republican lawmakers after he announced that he wanted to use unspent TARP money for tax breaks for small businesses and investments in infrastructure projects  among other things Then  US Rep Mike Pence of Indiana  chairman of the House Republican Conference  said  To use money from the TARP fund in the manner that is being discussed by the White House and congressional Democrats would be a violation of the law  and it would betray the trust of the American people We found Pences claim to be Half True On one hand  the TARP legislation is quite clear  Section 106  Part D of the TARP legislation  Revenues of  and proceeds from the sale of troubled assets purchased under this Act  or from the sale  exercise  or surrender of warrants or senior debt instruments acquired under section 113 shall be paid into the general fund of the Treasury for reduction of the public debt But we also talked with budget experts who said that Congress could get around those rules in a number of ways For example  Congress could rescind the TARP money and then  in a separate action  use it to pay other expenses  said Brian Riedl  lead budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation Congress can of course vote to spend new money on anything it wants  Dean Baker  an economist and co director of the left leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington  told us in December In Greggs case  though  hes strictly talking about what the law says  that TARP money cannot be used for anything other than deficit reduction,0,1,519,real

If you believe the former  you would support trying the accused in front of military commissions at the Guantanamo Bay detention center If you believe the latter  you would favor trying them in US courts Biden offered a full throated defense of Obama administration plans to try Khalid Sheik Mohammed in US courts  even though the administration supports commissions for some cases One of Bidens arguments was that US courts work better and result in tougher sentences Let me put this in perspective  Biden said on Face the Nation There have been three people tried and convicted by the last administration in military courts Two are walking the street right now There have been over 300 tried in federal courts by the last administration and by us Theyre all in jail now None of them are out seeing the light of day Were looking into Bidens assertion that more than 300 people have been tried in federal courts and will post our findings soon Here  we are examining Bidens assertion that three people were tried and convicted by the last administration in military commissions  and that two of three have been released After consulting news reports and military documents  we discovered that Biden was correct We also checked with experts who both support and oppose military commissions for various reasons  and no one disputed Bidens numbers Before we summarize the three cases  we should point out a few things about military commissions  which Congress authorized in laws passed in 2006 and 2009 The commissions operate under rules that are more favorable to the government than the rules typically found in federal courts  and the jurors are all members of the military But that doesnt mean prosecutors always get what they want In some cases  juries refuse to convict  and a military judge can allow or exclude evidence Here are the details on the three cases    David Hicks of Australia was the first person convicted by a military commission under the Military Commissions Act of 2006  according to the Department of Defense A native Australian  Hicks was a convert to Islam who was in Afghanistan before Sept 11  2001  and was picked up by US forces in December of that year The government said he had trained in al Qaida camps Hicks case gained prominence in Australia  with members of the public urging his release In a plea deal  Hicks pleaded guilty in March 2007 to one charge of providing material support to terrorism  an offense with a maximum sentence of life in prison The commission sentenced Hicks to seven years  though most of that was suspended in an agreement that sent Hicks back to Australia to serve out his sentence Hicks left an Australian prison and returned home in December 2007 On his release  Hicks issued a statement saying he intended to honor a plea deal not to talk to the media for one year  though he did add  I would like to recognize the huge debt of gratitude that I owe the Australian public for getting me home Hicks married in 2009 and is reportedly writing a book   Salim Hamdan was Osama bin Ladens driver Prosecutors argued he was a dangerous terrorist  while his defense attorneys said he was a low level aide The military commissions jury found him guilty of providing material support for terrorism in August 2008  but sentenced him to little more than time served The Bush administration sent him back to Yemen in November 2008 Reuters reported that the Yemeni government released him from jail in January 2009  Hamdan was the petitioner in Hamdan vs Rumsfeld  the US Supreme Court case that overturned initial Bush administration efforts at setting up military commissions  In August  he was living with his wife and two daughters in Sanaa  Yemen   Ali Hamza al Bahlul made propaganda videos at the direction of Osama bin Laden In November 2009  a military commission jury convicted him of 35 counts of conspiracy  solicitation to commit murder and providing material support for terrorism Not only did Bahlul not allow his attorneys to put on a defense  but he also told the jury he volunteered for the 9 11 terrorist attacks and that bin Laden turned him down  according to press reports The jury sentenced him to life in prison  and Bahlul remains in the Guantanamo Bay detention facility To be fair  we asked a supporter of military commissions about Bidens point  that there havent been many convictions through military tribunals Andrew McCarthy  a former assistant US attorney and a national security commentator for the conservative National Review  said that the commissions have been constantly challenged by liberal attorneys  which has hampered their progress It is more than a little rich for the very people who moved heaven and earth to prevent the commissions from being completed now complain that we didnt complete very many commissions  McCarthy said In the interview on Face the Nation  Biden said he believed traditional federal courts would provide the longest sentences to terrorists  based on their track record of convictions Of Khalid Sheik Mohammed  Biden said  Looking at the evidence thats been made available to me as part of  in a generic sense  the executive

1892,2010-06-14T15:26:55-04:00,2010,abcnewsgocom,John Boehner,The House has never failed to pass a budget in the modern era,On the June 13  2010  edition of ABCs This Week  House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer  D Md  and House Minority Leader John Boehner  R Ohio  got into a back and forth over how diligent lawmakers have been in passing a budget in recent years Hoyer said that the Republicans didnt have a budget in 02  04  06  while Boehner claimed the House has never failed to pass a budget in the modern era With dueling claims like these  we had no choice but to step in and play referee In this item  well look at what Boehner said  in a separate item  well look at Hoyers comment First  a little background The budget process used by Congress today was set forth in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 Both the Senate and the House are supposed to pass resolutions in the spring that outline the framework for future bills that address spending  taxation and other fiscal policy items This budget represents a plan for allocating revenues and expenditures for the coming fiscal year  as well as for the next four fiscal years in more general terms Each chamber is supposed to pass a version of the resolution  and if the two versions differ  then the chambers jointly hammer out a compromise and pass it The budget process is distinct from the series of appropriations  or spending  bills that actually allocate money for specific purposes Unlike the appropriations bills  the budget resolution doesnt carry the force of law In fact  unlike a law  the budget resolution is not signed by the president after it passes both chambers If a budget resolution does not pass  the majority can still use parliamentary procedures to proceed to appropriations bills  but the inability to pass the budget framework can reflect poorly on the majoritys organizational skills and or the degree of partisan discord in Congress It also increases the likelihood of a logjam of appropriations bills in the fall and winter and decreases the chance that controversial tax bills will pass the Senate Thats why the expected failure of the Democratic House majority to pass a budget for fiscal year 2011 has become a talking point for Republicans According to the Congressional Research Service  the nonpartisan research arm of Congress  the House has indeed passed a budget every year since the Congressional Budget Act first took effect for fiscal year 1976 So if the House does not pass a budget for fiscal year 2011  it will be the first time since the current rules went into force However  we should also note that the House has not always been joined by the Senate in passing a budget    a factor that explains the difference between what Boehner and Hoyer said Since 1983    the first year the House and Senate stopped passing two budget resolutions annually and began passing one per year    the two chambers failed to pass a joint budget bill on four occasions For fiscal year 2003  the Senate  then under Democratic control  failed to pass a budget resolution of any kind  and on three other occasions  fiscal years 1999  2005 and 2007  the House and Senate failed to reconcile their different bills and pass a compromise measure Because Congress always works on the budget resolution for the coming fiscal year  the Republican Congressional majority failed to pass a finished budget in three years  1998  2004 and 2006 So Boehner is correct that the House has always passed a budget resolution  even though on three occasions  it later failed to work out differences with the Senate and pass a final  identical version  and once the Senate  under Democratic control  had no budget resolution Well note that caveat  but we dont think his failure to mention that point undermines the accuracy of his statement,0,0,628,real
1442,2010-01-28T18:00:16-05:00,2010,republicanleaderhousegov,John Boehner,President Obamas proposed spending freeze will only reduce the  42 trillion in government spending proposed between 2011 and 2020 by little more than one half of 1 percent,In his State of the Union address on Jan 27  2010  President Barack Obama unveiled a proposal to freeze discretionary spending for three years to help dig the country out of a massive fiscal hole But Obama included some caveats He said the freeze would exclude spending on national security as well as entitlement programs such as Medicare  Medicaid and Social Security And the freeze wont take effect until next year  when the economy is stronger  he said Understand  Obama said  if we dont take meaningful steps to rein in our debt  it could damage our markets  increase the cost of borrowing  and jeopardize our recovery    all of which would have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes That kind of belt tightening talk makes for good sound bites  Republican leaders said afterward  but the freeze described by Obama  while a small step in the right direction  amounts to a tiny sliver of the countrys massive  and growing  debt President Obamas proposed spending freeze will only reduce the  42 trillion in government spending proposed between 2011 and 2020 by little more than one half of 1 percent  House Republican Leader John Boehner wrote in a live blog during Obamas speech But first  are Boehners numbers themselves accurate? A report released this week from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the federal government will spend  429 trillion over the next 10 years The Obama administration itself says the freeze on nondefense discretionary spending would save  250 billion over 10 years That number  however  is a bit more speculative than the CBOs overall estimate Speaking before the Senate Budget Committee on Jan 28  2010  Douglas W Elmendorf  director of the Congressional Budget Office  said his office did not have enough details from the White House about which categories of spending would be exempt from Obamas pledge Those details will be revealed when the White House presents its proposed 2011 budget next week But Elmendorf said perhaps the most crucial factor in determining the long term effect of the freeze is what happens in the years after the freeze If spending immediately goes back to the levels they would have been at had they been rising all along  then the savings are just in those three years  and theyre small  Elmendorf said For example  Elmendorf said  a freeze on all discretionary appropriations would only save about  10 billion in fiscal year 2011 But  he said  if you essentially reset spending levels and only increase at the rate of inflation after the freeze  then you can achieve significant savings over the remaining years Thats the route White House officials have said they want to go So that  250 billion figure cited by the White House seems in line with other estimates And by that measure  Boehners attempt to put Obamas proposal into context is accurate A freeze that would cut spending by  250 billion over 10 years amounts to a little more than one half of 1 percent of all government spending over that same period But he also relied on math that made Obamas freeze look especially tiny because the other number he cited     42 trillion in overall spending    includes mandatory entitlement programs such as Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid as well as discretionary nondefense and defense programs If you remove those items  Obamas freeze accounts for a slightly larger share    about 4 percent over 10 years The White House  however  puts a more optimistic spin on this statistic saying that by the middle of the decade  nonsecurity discretionary spending would reach its lowest percentage of gross domestic product in 50 years Still the big picture point made by Boehner and other Republicans is that Obamas proposed three year spending freeze  which would apply only to about 17 percent of overall spending  does little to address the massive fiscal hole he described In sum  the outlook for the federal budget is bleak  Elmendorf said So how much of a dent would Obamas freeze make? As a share of the total deficit problem  it is a small step  Elmendorf said So Obama positioned the spending freeze as a way to rein in the countrys mounting debt  and we think its fair for Boehner to put those spending cuts in the context of overall spending,2,0,714,real
1825,2010-05-25T17:18:46-04:00,2010,abcnewsgocom,Michael Steele,The Republican Party fought very hard in the 60s to get the civil rights bill passed  as well as the voting rights bill,When Rand Paul of Kentucky followed up his victory in the May 18  2010  Republican US Senate primary by saying that he had some reservations about the philosophical underpinnings of the Civil Rights Act  it prompted criticism from across the ideological spectrum I like the Civil Rights Act in a sense that it ended discrimination in all public domains  Paul said in an interview with MSNBCs Rachel Maddow I abhor racism I think its a bad business decision to ever exclude anybody from your restaurant But at the same time  I do believe in private ownership Theres 10 different titles  you know  to the Civil Rights Act One deals with private institutions  and had I been around  I would have tried to modify that Paul eventually retracted his comments  but they nonetheless sparked a media frenzy On ABCs This Week  Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele    his partys first African American chairman    made a point of arguing that his party had been on the forefront of civil rights when the landmark act Rand was referring to was passed in 1964  as well as the Voting Rights Act that passed the following year Our party has always had a strong view on this issue  Steele told ABCs Jake Tapper We fought very hard in the 60s to get the civil rights bill passed as well as the voting rights bill We decided to see whether Steele was correct The Civil Rights Act    which is best known for barring discrimination in public accommodations    passed the House on Feb 10  1964 by a margin of 290 130 When broken down by party  61 percent of Democratic lawmakers voted for the bill  152 yeas and 96 nays   and a full 80 percent of the Republican caucus supported it  138 yeas and 34 nays  When the Senate passed the measure on June 19  1964     nine days after supporters mustered enough votes to end the longest filibuster in Senate history    the margin was 73 27 Better than two thirds of Senate Democrats supported the measure on final passage  46 yeas  21 nays   but an even stronger 82 percent of Republicans supported it  27 yeas  6 nays  The primary reason that Republican support was higher than Democratic support    even though the legislation was pushed hard by a Democratic president  Lyndon B Johnson    is that the opposition to the bill primarily came from Southern lawmakers In the mid 1960s  the South was overwhelmingly Democratic    a legacy of the Civil War and Reconstruction  when the Republican Party was the leading force against slavery and its legacy Because of this history  the Democratic Party in the 1960s was divided between Southern Democrats  most of whom opposed civil rights legislation  and Democrats from outside the South who more often than not supported it This pattern showed clearly in the House vote Northern Democrats backed the Civil Rights Act by a margin even larger than that of Republicans    141 for  just four against    while Southern Democrats were strongly opposed  by a margin of 11 yeas to 92 nays When the Voting Rights Act hit the floor in 1965  the vote results mirrored those of the Civil Rights Act In the House  the measure passed by a 333 85 margin  with 78 percent of Democrats backing it  221 yeas and 61 nays  and 82 percent of Republicans backing it  112 yeas to 24 nays  In the Senate  the measure passed by a 77 19 vote  with 73 percent of Democrats and 94 percent of Republicans supporting the bill So its clear that Republican support for both bills was deep But to make sure we werent missing something  we contacted a number of scholars who have studied that period  asking whether Republicans were dragged into supporting the bills reluctantly  or whether they took frontline roles in advancing them Generally speaking  the scholars we talked to agreed that Republicans were important players  usually working cooperatively with Johnson and other leading Democrats Democrats deserve credit for being the driving force behind the legislation  our experts said  particularly Johnson  who had only been in office for three months yet who staked his own re election prospects on a tough  divisive legislative battle Other crucial Democratic players were Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield of Montana and Sen Hubert H Humphrey of Minnesota  who had been championing the issue of civil rights for a decade and a half But Republicans took leading positions as well  including Rep Charles  Mac  Mathias of Maryland and Sen Jacob Javits of New York And during the 1950s  a Republican president  Dwight Eisenhower  had supported a civil rights legislation  though he never signed anything as sweeping as either the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Rights Act In the strategic challenge of getting the Civil Rights Act passed  Democrats knew that they would need to reach out to Republicans in order to overcome their own partys splits on the issue    especially in the Senate  where a determined minority of one third of the chamber could block consideration of a bill  Today that number is two fifths  The key to Senate passage of the Civil Rights Act was winning the support of Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen  R Ill  our experts said By various accounts  Dirksen had some reservations with certain provisions of the Civil Rights Act  but Mansfield and Humphrey worked very closely with him  and key parts of the bill were worked out in Dirksens office in the evenings  said US Senate Historian Donald A Ritchie Other midwestern Republicans followed Dirksens lead and supported the bill Once the filibuster was broken  Time magazine put Dirksen on its cover  You can gauge Everett Dirksen and the Republicans in various ways  but you have to give them real credit  said University of Kansas political scientist Burdett Loomis  who called Dirksen a tough  veteran politician  and a pragmatist of the first order To be sure  Republican support was not unanimous Most notably  the partys 1964 presidential nominee  Barry Goldwater  voted against the Civil Rights Act and stuck to that position during the campaign  which he lost to Johnson in a landslide  And Yale University political scientist David Mayhew notes that the large Republican vote totals for the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act were not replicated in other key civil rights battles  such as an earlier one relating to fair employment practices in 1949 and 1950 and a subsequent one on fair housing in 1966 But on the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act  the most notable factor affecting how Republicans voted was pragmatism  said Bert Rockman  a political scientist at Purdue University The Republicans of that era deserve credit  lots of it  but less in a partisan way than in a now long lost art form   forging a consensus around critical national problems Back to Steeles quote  We fought very hard in the 60s to get the civil rights bill passed as well as the voting rights bill The degree of Republican support for the two bills actually exceeded the degree of Democratic support  and its also fair to say that Republicans took leading roles in both measures  even though they had far fewer seats  and thus less power  at the time Both of these factors are enough to earn Steele a rating of True,0,0,1214,real

Well admit we had to  Google it In Internet geek  its trash talk that means you owned your  opponent Here it is  in a recent press release from House Republican Leader John Boehner  PWNED   House GOP Dominates Twitter  YouTube  Social Media in Congress The release said  The  conventional wisdom is being turned upside down as House Republicans demonstrate  an unmatched ability to connect with the American people on the Internets most  popular communities Once considered the party of online innovation  new  research and a host of media reports show that Democrats are largely ignoring  some of the most popular social media communities on the Web Indeed  theres been a  widespread perception that Democrats had the lead During the presidential  campaign  the Washington Post dubbed Barack Obama the king of social  networking By nearly every social networking measure    Facebook  MySpace   YouTube and Twitter    Obamas engagement and influence dwarfed the McCain  campaign Obamas text messaging became a powerful grass roots tool for getting  out his message and raising money The Obama campaign even mocked Sen John  McCain for his inability to navigate the Internet and ran an ad linking him to a  record player and a Rubiks Cube We decided to fact check Boehners boast about  Republican domination of social media in Congress First stop   Twitter Earlier  this month  Mark Senak  senior vice president and partner at Fleishman Hillard  a public relations firm  in Washington  DC  issued a report titled Twongress  The Power of Twitter in  Congress in which he analyzed the Twitter use of all members of Congress The  findings surprised him In Congress  he found  there are 132 members using Twitter actively  89 Republicans and 43 Democrats It breaks down like  this  In the Senate  there are 14 Republicans using Twitter compared to 11  Democrats  and in the House  there are 75 Republicans using Twitter  4213  percent of the Republican caucus  and 32 Democrats  1245 percent of the  Democratic caucus  And the GOP leads in tweet production  Republicans  send out more tweets and have the attention of many more people than do the  Democrats  the report says The disparity in Twitter usage was most pronounced in  the House In the House  only one Democrat ranks in the top 10 in terms of the  number of followers  and only two are in the top 20 Not only do more House  Republicans actively use Twitter  they have many more followers and send out far  more Twitter messages  29 162 tweets compared to 5 503 for their Democratic  counterparts  according to the report  which tallied their messages through the  end of 2009 The  power of Twitter  however  is not just in the number of followers you have and  how many messages you send out a day The idea is to get people on your  followers list to re tweet    pass on    your message  potentially exposing  your message to an exponentially larger group So analysts also look at your  influence and clout  which factors in how often people re tweet and cite  your messages And by that measure  House Republicans are far outpacing  Democrats Measured  by the sheer number of followers  Boehner leads the Republicans in the House  with 18 800  followed by Minority Whip Eric Cantor  R Va  with 16 500 But it  was Rep Ileana Ros Lehtinen  R Fla  who led House Republicans in clout and  influence because she is re tweeted so often And for the record   the supposedly out of touch McCain beats everyone in Congress for total  followers  with nearly 16 million When I first saw the results  I was surprised   Senak told PolitiFact That was a counterintuitive finding after the Obama  campaign But when when I thought about it  the party that is not in power  always has had to be more aggressive in using communication tools to get their  message So Round  1  Twitter  to House Republicans What about YouTube? On Jan 21  2010   YouTubes CitizenTube posted a year end wrap up that showed 89 percent of  Republicans and 74 percent of Democrats in Congress have started YouTube  channels to engage their constituents More importantly  people are watching the  Republican channels much more often According to the report  eight of the top  10 most viewed and most subscribed YouTube channels in Congress are from the  GOP  though Democrats took two of the top three spots The top 4  in order  are  Rep Alan Grayson  D Fla  Rep Ron Paul  R Texas  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi   D Calif  and Boehner A tracking of YouTube views by industry analyst TubeMogul shows that with few exceptions  Republican videos consistently drew more clicks than those from Democrats None of the videos have gone viral  said David Burch of TubeMogul  and no one is getting huge viewership Obama spoiled us in terms of what a lot means  during the campaign  he said Obama remains on the cutting edge On Jan 25  2010  the administration rolled out a new White House iPhone app which will allow users to watch White House live streaming video Still  in Congress  the GOP is ahead Round 2  YouTube  to Republicans And lastly  Facebook  the favorite of former Alaska Gov Sarah Palin Palins Facebook page has more than 12 million fans No one in the House has that kind of reach And we couldnt find any comprehensive analysis of engagement on FaceBook by members of Congress But as of Jan 22  2010  Boehner had 31 757 fans of his page  compared to 8 745 for Pelosi Boehners director of new media  Nick Schaper  said House Republicans are building an important lead in social media Were pretty proud of that  he said For many Republicans  the Obama campaign was a real eye opener to the power of social media tools And so Republican leaders made a conscious effort to ramp up their involvement In weekly meetings  members of the Republican conference routinely discuss their social media successes and talk about how best to use various tools Engagement in new social media just makes sense  Schaper said Its easy to use  but it takes commitment Boehner typically tweets about 5 to 10 times a day The more active you are  the more followers you get  Schaper explained Everyone on the press team considers Twitter an important part of the process We make it a focus  not a secondary kind of thing Its a great resource to reach people with your message  he said Boehner might only have about 19 000 followers on Twitter  but if enough people re tweet some of his messages  he can reach a couple hundred thousand people in just a couple hours But while House Republicans may rightly crow about deeper engagement in social media than their Democratic counterparts  Senak  the author of the study  says neither side is doing particularly well compared to other large institutions Both parties have a minority of members engaged in Twitter And neither side has fully embraced the give and take of Twitter Most members have elected to follow very few other people and rarely re tweet In other words  he said  they are mostly using Twitter as a soapbox Both sides have room for a tremendous amount of improvement  Senak said But the bottom line is that Boehner is correct when he boasts that the House GOP dominates the Democrats on Twitter  YouTube and other social media in Congress Still  we had to ask  is Boehner really so plugged in that he knows what PWNED means?

Will it abuse people? Will it raise a dust cloud of unintended and unhappy consequences? Will we be embarrassed by some of what we approve here today? The answer is yes  yes  yes and yes The portion of the stimulus plan that came before Energy and Commerce Committee includes about  170 billion in proposed spending No one challenges the claim that the massive spending bill is being fast tracked At a congressional forum on Jan 7  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi explained the urgency this way  Nothing could be clearer than the fact that we need action and we need action now A failure to act quickly can only lead to more job losses and more economic pain for Americans If we act boldly and rapidly  we can begin to create new jobs and opportunities today and strengthen our economy  as you said  for the long run President Obama has said he wants to have the package approved by mid February Republicans have cried foul  saying there has been little effort by Democrats to craft a bipartisan package  and that they only received a draft of the proposal on Jan 16 Less than a week later  the plan came before the House Appropriations  Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce committees   for one day of markups That means committee members can propose amendments On Jan 22  Bartons Energy and Commerce Committee  on which he is the senior Republican  held a marathon 12 hour markup session during which numerous amendments were added to the proposal The fate of amendments largely depended on which side of the aisle the suggestions came from  as nearly all of the dozens of Republican backed amendments were rejected Don Ritchie  associate historian of the Senate Historical Office  said while congressional committees are typically permitted hearings on major spending plans  when theres an emergency  they tend not to go along in regular order  When the leadership of both houses agrees its important enough to circumvent  then theyll go around the regular order The minority party almost always objects  he said  but both parties have done it when they control the majority Its not unprecedented by any means  Ritchie said of bypassing hearings But it is unusual for such a large spending plan There hasnt been anything of that magnitude in a long time  Ritchie said That stands out by itself  I think Barton used words like abomination and truly an insult to describe the fast tracking of the plan By way of explaining the need for a streamlined review  Committee Chairman Rep Henry A Waxman said  We are in a deep and long recession Our unemployment rate is over 7 percent and growing We urgently need an economic recovery package   and we need it immediately On Jan 23  Obama met with Republican leadership to get their input on the proposed stimulus package  and he agreed to meet with the Republican caucuses this week  though many Republicans scoffed at the suggestion it will result in anything close to a bipartisan plan One can argue whether the urgency of the economic crisis outweighs the need for deliberate consideration through congressional hearings  but Barton is right  There have been no hearings on the massive stimulus package that Congress is expected to vote on as early as this week We rule his statement True,4,0,811,real

Drilling in the Atlantic    like in the eastern Gulf of Mexico    has been taboo until recently The Minerals Management Service  an arm of the US Department of the Interior  has not held a lease sale for oil or natural gas drilling in the Atlantic since 1983 No leases remain active The MMS  however  included 29 million acres off the shores of Virginia as part of its 2007 2012 gas and oil leasing program But exploration was prohibited by both executive order and a congressional moratorium That changed in the summer of 2008 President George W Bush lifted the executive order banning drilling  then Congress allowed the moratorium to expire In November of that year  the MMS initiated what it called a multiyear leasing process for the rights to drill off Virginias coast The area potentially open to drilling would start 50 miles offshore and sits north of the opening of the Chesapeake Bay  closest to Virginias Eastern Shore counties on the Delmarva Peninsula The MMS says the area may contain 130 million barrels of oil and 114 trillion cubic feet of natural gas Its the only area in the Atlantic under consideration Why is McDonnell bringing this up? He believes the Obama administration has done little to move the lease sale ahead The MMS says it wont happen before 2011 In a letter to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Dec 23  2009  McDonnell pressed for prompt action  saying drilling could create 2 578 new jobs over 10 years and  271 million in state and local taxes Those figures  which McDonnell says were based on a 2005 report by the former president of Old Dominion University  subsequently have been questioned  But thats not what were checking McDonnell said Virginia was ready to be the first state on the East Coast to explore for and produce oil and natural gas offshore Indeed  the nearly 3 million acres off the coast of Virginia is the only area in the Atlantic in the federal governments current five year oil and gas leasing program It also is the only area currently in the leasing process It puts Virginia at the head of the class And it makes McDonnell right,2,0,474,real

Hatch said in an interview on CNNs State of the Union That struck us as high  so we decided to see if Hatch was right First  a word about how the subsidies work in the bill  which was signed into law on March 23  2010 The subsidies will take effect in 2014 and are available to Americans who buy insurance on exchanges  which will be virtual marketplaces for health plans The exchanges are designed to serve people who do not already have insurance through their employer and who are not covered by a government program such as Medicare or Medicaid The bill offers two kinds of subsidies to people who buy through the exchange    one for insurance premiums and one for out of pocket medical costs Under the premium subsidy  the government will pay the difference between the premiums for a designated plan and a set percentage of your income As for the cost sharing subsidy  the mechanism is still evolving  but the idea is to reduce the amount that beneficiaries have to shell out for co pays and other medical expenses The subsidies will operate on a sliding scale  benefiting those who earn between 133 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level At the upper end of the range of those who qualify for premium subsidies    those earning 300 percent to 400 percent of poverty level    the government will pay whatever amount of the premium that exceeds 95 percent of the beneficiarys income  Those earning less than 133 percent of the poverty level qualify for Medicaid  Officially  the federal poverty limit for a family of four is  22 050  and 400 percent of that amount would be  88 200 We checked with several health care experts and they confirmed that that would indeed be the top income at which someone could receive subsidies That means that many people earning the subsidies will actually earn more than the median income for married couple familes     73 010 On the other hand  how big  88 200 is depends on where you live In four states   88 200 is actually below the median income for a family of four    in New Jersey   94 441   Maryland   94 017   Connecticut   93 821  and Massachusetts   89 347  In each of these states  the cost of living is quite a bit higher than the national average  and in many cases these states have health insurance mandates that boost premiums above the national average By contrast   88 200 is well above the median income in Arkansas   52 185   Mississippi   52 992  and Hatchs state of Utah   63 586  The bill does not include any mechanism to even out such geographic variations Another point  Families making  88 200  wherever they are  will have to spend significantly before they see any federal subsidy kick in The maximum someone would have to pay for health insurance premiums before subsidies kick in is  8 379  or 95 percent times  88 200  For most people  thats a hefty premium On average  a workers share of health care premiums at smaller companies  three to 199 employees  that use an HMO for full family coverage amounted to  5 039 in 2009  according to the annual survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research   Educational Trust Still  premiums north of  8 000 are conceivable Costs would be higher for those seeking insurance on the individual market  if coverage can be found   and the price would likely be higher in more expensive states In the meantime  premiums could be especially steep for older Americans who are not yet 65    the age they can enroll in Medicare Those aged 64 can be charged up to three times as much as an 18 year old for the same coverage  said Linda Blumberg  a senior fellow at the Urban Institute So families that include older adults could face very high premiums relative to their incomes  even at 400 percent of the poverty level  making it unaffordable for such families to purchase coverage without a subsidy All of this helps explain the rationale for why a family earning  88 200 might need federal assistance But it doesnt undermine the validity of Hatchs point Starting in 2014  the health care bill will indeed subsidize  families of four that make over  80 000 a year,1,0,798,real
1419,2010-01-25T15:15:55-05:00,2010,frwebgateaccessgpogov,Carolyn Maloney,Democratic presidents have been considerably more effective at creating private sector jobs,As the recession continues to inflict economic pain on most Americans  the political battle to frame the debate rages on In a House floor speech on Jan 21  2010  Rep Carolyn Maloney  D NY  held up a chart showing job creation statistics under two former presidents  Bill Clinton and George W Bush This chart goes back to 1992  the year that President  Bill  Clinton was elected  Maloney said It shows that during his time there was very robust job creation in the private sector  and then during the Bush years it fell dramatically This dark line is the job creation  going up during the Clinton years  falling dramatically under the  George W  Bush administration It also shows that Democrats have been considerably more effective at creating private sector jobs We wondered whether that pattern held true for other presidents as well  or whether Maloney had simply chosen two presidencies that conveniently showed her party in the most favorable light So we ran the numbers and got some interesting results We did this by turning to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Web site  where visitors can customize data tables on national employment statistics We used the month by month totals for nonfarm employment in the United States  We actually ran the numbers twice    once using Maloneys cited statistic  private sector employment  and a second time using the combination of private sector and government employment It turned out that the general trends were virtually identical  so well be sticking with the statistics on just private sector employment below  The BLS data go back to 1939  but since that fell in the middle of Franklin D Roosevelts presidency  we skipped forward to Harry Truman and compared him and all of his post World War II successors We also did some minor massaging of the numbers in order to make the statistics more comparable First  we calculated how much the number of jobs rose or fell on each presidents watch Then we divided that result by the number of jobs there were when the president began his first term  in order to get a percentage increase in jobs over that presidents tenure This enabled us to minimize the effect of population growth  which would otherwise credit later presidents with larger employment increases than earlier ones Next  we divided this job growth percentage by the number of years the president occupied the Oval Office  creating a statistic that calculates percentage job growth per year as president This allowed us to more fairly compare the job growth rates under  say  Gerald Ford with those of two termers such as Ronald Reagan and Clinton Finally  we lumped the Democratic presidents annual job growth percentages together and averaged them  and did the same for the Republicans Because President Barack Obama has served just one year in office    a length of time that some would consider statistically problematic    we ran the Democratic numbers both with and without Obama  so that readers could choose their preferred statistic Before we provide the final totals  lets run down how each president did Here are the average annual percentage increases in jobs for each postwar president  Harry S Truman  Democrat   increase of 295 percent a year Dwight D Eisenhower  Republican   increase of 050 percent a year John F Kennedy  Democrat   increase of 203 percent a year Lyndon B Johnson  Democrat   increase of 388 percent a year Richard M Nixon  Republican   increase of 216 percent a year Gerald R Ford  Republican   increase of 086 percent a year Jimmy Carter  Democrat   increase of 345 percent a year Ronald Reagan  Republican   increase of 246 percent a year George HW Bush  Republican   increase of 040 percent a year Bill Clinton  Democrat   increase of 286 percent a year George W Bush  Republican   increase of 001 percent a year Barack Obama  Democrat   decrease of 30 percent a year  Can we take time out here to say how surprised we are that Eisenhower  who presided over the happy 1950s  managed an anemic half percent job growth per year  while Jimmy Malaise Carter finished second with 345 percent annual job growth?  Now for the totals If you exclude Obama  Democrats averaged 303 percent annual job growth  compared to 107 percent for Republicans    a nearly 3 to 1 advantage If you include Obama  the Democrats still held a significant edge With Obama included  the Democrats averaged 203 annual job growth  compared to the same 107 for Republicans    about twice as high as the GOP And based on some quick calculations he did  Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless said that the US working age population actually grew slightly faster under Republican presidents  making the Democratic accomplishment even more impressive So the statistics are clear  Democratic presidents have been more successful at creating jobs But how much importance should we assign to this fact? We hereby list some caveats that we and several historians we contacted came up with    The president actually deserves less credit for the good times    and less blame for the bad times Its a truism of politics that when things go well  the president generally gets too much credit  and when things dont go well  the president usually gets too much blame Shouldnt the Republican Congress of 1995 2001 get a share of the credit for Clintons robust job growth? Shouldnt the Democratic House that served under Reagan? Most experts would say yes and yes    Timing can be hugely important Statistics about employment growth over presidential terms are dominated by the timing of the business cycle  including Federal Reserve policy  and have no apparent connection to economic policies attributed to the White House  as opposed to Congress  said Alan Reynolds  a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute One example  Clinton had the good fortune to enter office when the economy had just undergone a recession This relatively low starting point made it easier for him to rack up big gains over eight years The converse is true for George W Bush  He took office right as the tech bubble was bursting  meaning that any jobs he added to the nations total amounted to digging the country out of a jobs hole    Outside factors can play a big role Trumans private sector employment numbers likely benefited from the post World War II demobilization of troops  Private sector jobs grew at 295 percent per year during his presidency  compared to 27 percent a year for all jobs  Meanwhile  Lyndon Johnson took office right as the first wave of baby boomers was turning 18  a fact that almost certainly boosted his job creation figures And research by James D Hamilton  an economist at the University of California at San Diego has shown that oil price shocks    something entirely out of a presidents control    have caused most postwar recessions As Yale political scientist David Mayhew points out  conclusions drawn from a relatively narrow data set    in this case  just 12 postwar presidencies    need to be taken with a grain of salt Still  most experts we spoke to agreed that the pattern is too consistent to dismiss out of hand And its not the only one that reflects a strong correlation between an economic factor and the presidents partisan affiliation In his 2008 book Unequal Democracy  Princeton University political scientist Larry Bartels showed that changes in income inequality are strongly correlated with the presidents party Under every postwar Republican president  Bartels concluded  the gap between rich and poor has grown  and under every Democratic president except for Carter  that gap has shrunk  For those on the lookout for ideological bias  Bartels made a point of writing in his introduction that he is an unusually apolitical political scientist who last voted in 1984  for Reagan I was quite surprised to discover how often and how profoundly partisan differences in ideologies and values have shaped key policy decisions and economic outcomes  he wrote I have done my best to follow my evidence where it led me  Ultimately  the experts we contacted said that  despite the caveats  Maloneys calculations  and our expansion of them  were justified This is a reasonable exercise in the scheme of things  said liberal economist Dean Baker Obviously  luck matters a lot  but when there is a consistent pattern over more than 60 years  it starts to look like more than just luck Kevin Hassett  an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute and a former economic adviser to the Republican presidential campaigns of George W Bush and John McCain  argued that the best way to evaluate presidents is to look at their policies Still  he added  calculations like Maloneys are worth doing They can be thought provoking and can ignite debates that help inform,4,0,1442,real

page numbers in the stimulus for reference  and added a  brief explainer for some If your eyes glaze over midway through  feel free to  skip ahead to the bottom of the list where well pick up our analysis Individual Tax  Cuts  1 Making  Work Pay Tax Credit  Sec 1001  Page 195  In tax years 2009 and 2010  the  Making Work Pay provision will provide a refundable tax credit of 62 percent of  earned income up to  400 for individuals and up to  800 for married taxpayers  filing joint returns 2 Increase in the Earned Income Tax Credit  Sec  1002  Page 198  Go to the stimulus bill for all the details  but it essentially  expands this benefit for the working poor 3 Increased Eligibility for the Refundable Portion  of Child Credit  Sec 1003  Page 199  In 2009 and 2010  families who dont earn  enough to pay income tax would be eligible to claim the  1 000 child credit 4 American  Opportunity Education Tax Credit  Sec 1004  Page 199  Increases the Hope  Scholarship Credit to  2 500 5 Refundable First time Home Buyer Credit  Sec  1006  Page 202  This extended and increased the first time home buyer tax  credit from  7 500 to  8 000 6 Temporary Suspension of Taxation of Unemployment  Benefits  Sec 1007  Page 203  This exempts from taxable gross income the first   2 400 of unemployment benefits 7 Tax Credits for Energy Efficient Improvements to  Existing Homes  Sec 1121  Page 208  This provides up to a  1 500 tax credit  for qualified energy efficiency improvements 8 Sales Tax Deduction for Vehicle Purchases  Sec  1008  Page 203  This allows people to write off state and local sales taxes  related to the purchase of a new vehicle costing up to  49 500 9 Premium Credits for  COBRA Continuation Coverage for Unemployed Workers  Sec 6432  Page 348  10 Economic Recovery Credits to Recipients of  Social Security  SSI  Railroad Retirement and Veterans Disability Compensation  Benefits  Sec 2201  Page 336  This was a  250 payment for senior citizens   disabled veterans and disabled people living on Social Security benefits 11 Computers as  Qualified Education Expenses in 529 Education Plans  Sec 1005  Page 202  This  allows college students to write off the expense of computers and software   provided its for educational purpose and not for games 12 Plug in Electric  Drive Vehicle Credit  Sec 1141  Page 212  Allows purchasers of plug in  electric vehicles to write off up to  5 000 of their purchase  depending on the  power of the battery  13 Tax Parity for Transit Benefits  sec 1151  Page  219  This relates to an increased exclusion amount for commuter transit  benefits and transit passes 14 Health Coverage Tax Credit Expansion  Sec 1899   Page 309  Small  Business Tax Cuts  1 Extension of Enhanced Small Business Expensing   Sec 1202  Page 221  This is a temporary increase in limitations on expensing  some depreciable business assets 2 5 Year Carryback of Net Operating Losses for Small  Businesses  Sec 1211  Page 221  3 Extension of Bonus Depreciation  Sec 1201  Page  220  This extends by a year election to accelerate the AMT and Research Credits  in lieu of bonus depreciation 4 Exclusion of 75  of Small Business Capital Gains  from Taxes  Sec 1241  Page 228  5 Temporary Small Business Estimated Tax Payment  Relief  Sec 1212  Page 222  6 Temporary Reduction of S Corporation Built In  Gains Holding Period from 10 Years to 7 Years  Sec 1251  Page 228  Other Business Tax  Cuts  1 Advanced Energy Investment Credit  Sec 1302   Page 231  This relates to properties designed to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions  such as those that produce energy from  the sun  wind  geothermal deposits  fuel cells  microturbines  or an energy  storage system for use with electric or hybrid electric vehicles 2 Tax Credits for  Alternative Refueling Property  Sec 1123  Page 211  This is a temporary  increase for alternative fuel vehicle refueling businesses 3 Work Opportunity Tax Credits for Hiring  Unemployed Veterans and Disconnected Youth  Sec 1221  Page

reason of lacking a sufficient number of basic skills 4 Delayed Recognition  of Certain Cancellation of Debt Income  Sec 1231  Page 224  5 Election to  Accelerate Recognition of Historic AMT R D Credits  Sec 1201  Page 220  Grand total  25 In all  tax cuts  amounted to about a third of the cost of the  862 billion stimulus over the next  decade The biggest ticket tax cut was the first one on the list  the Making  Work Pay tax cut that is expected to cost the government about  116 billion over  two years Interestingly  the White House did not include the Alternative  Minimum Tax patch  which has been extended annually for years But that  accounted for another  70 billion for one year Together  those two items  account for the lions share of the tax cuts in the stimulus Which leads us to the  question of whether all of these 25 qualify as tax cuts? In a way this reminds  me of Clintons It depends on what your meaning of is is comments  said  Rosanne Altshuler  director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center It depends on  what you mean by tax cuts These are all provisions that cut your taxes  she  said  but most of them are temporary  designed to stimulate a floundering  economy Each of  the tax provisions in the stimulus could have been broken into separate bills   said Bob Williams  also of the Tax Policy Center  and on their own could have  rightly been billed as separate tax cuts They packed an awful lot into that bill  Williams  said I think its fair to say that various tax provisions in the stimulus  could be considered tax cuts I dont think thats being deceptive We agree But theres one other  element of Axelrods claim  that the tax cuts were passed without the help of  Republicans The  stimulus passed the House with nary a Republican vote And it passed the Senate  with just three  though we note that one of them  Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania   is now a Democrat  So its certainly fair to say the stimulus passed  without the help of the Republican caucus,1,0,1201,real

projects have produced They come to the ribbon cuttings,Twice recently  President Barack Obama has slammed congressional Republicans for voting against his economic stimulus bill in February 2009 but later touting provisions of the bill that benefited their own constituents During his Jan 29  2010  question and answer session with House Republican lawmakers in Baltimore  Obama brought up the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act  as the stimulus is officially known  There was an interesting headline in CNN today  Americans disapprove of stimulus  but like every policy in it And there was a poll that showed that if you broke it down into its component parts  80 percent approved of the tax cuts  80 percent approved of the infrastructure  80 percent approved of the assistance to the unemployed Well  thats what the Recovery Act was And lets face it  some of you have been at the ribbon cuttings for some of these important projects in your communities Then  on Feb 2  2010  Obama riffed on the same theme during a town hall event in New Hampshire  I have to point out  though  that some of the very same folks in Congress who opposed the Recovery Act    and claim that it hasnt worked    have been all too happy to claim credit for Recovery Act projects and the jobs those projects have produced  Applause  They come to the ribbon cuttings and   laughter  They found a way to have their cake and vote against it  too  Laughter  We decided that a claim that bold  repeated in two high profile events within a weeks time  was worth a fact check As it turns out  we found several cases in which lawmakers voted against the measure but later claimed credit for provisions or projects stemming from the stimulus bill    Rep Don Young of Alaska Young  who has served in Congress since 1973  sent out two press releases on Feb 13  2009  the day the House passed the final version of the stimulus bill One was headlined  Rep Young Votes NO On Democrats Massive Spending Bill It quotes Young saying  This bill was not a stimulus bill  it was a vehicle for pet projects  and thats wrong Youngs second release of the day was headlined  Rep Young Wins Victory For Alaska Small Business It explains how Young  after lobbying by the Alaska Federation of Natives  targeted a provision from the stimulus bill that would have required competitive bidding for stimulus grants and contracts The Alaska Natives group said the provision could have hurt its members ability to benefit from Small Business Administration programs Young  the release said  worked with Members on the other side of the aisle to make the case for these programs  and was able to get the provision pulled from the bill In the release  Young said that  no matter if I supported this bill or not  I would make sure  Alaska Natives  were not hurt by it    Rep Geoff Davis of Kentucky Davis  a three term congressman  issued a news release on Jan 28  2009  the day of the first House vote on the stimulus  in which he was quoted saying that this so calledstimulus legislation is full of pet spending projects that will do very little to restore confidence in our economy or create jobs But 11 months later  on Dec 16  2009  Davis sent out a release announcing the awarding of a  1 million plus grant for the Carroll County School District Congressman Geoff Davis is pleased to announce that the Carroll County School District has been awarded  1 044 140 in funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009  ARRA  Early Head Start Expansion Program  the release stated It goes on to say  In these difficult economic times  it is critical to ensure that vulnerable populations in Kentucky have access to important support services like those provided by the Early Head Start program This important grant will allow Carroll County School District to expand their ability to provide needed assistance to local low income families and children I am very proud of the work that the Carroll County School District is doing to strengthen their community  and I am pleased that our office was able to assist them in obtaining these funds  As it happened  on the very same day  Davis sent out a separate release in which he referred to the failed trillion dollar stimulus bill    Rep Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania Shuster  elected in 2001  is a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee During the stimulus debate  he advocated for targeting the measure more directly toward infrastructure spending A Jan 28  2009  news release from his office said that President Obama told the American people that he would stimulate our economy by rejuvenating our infrastructure As a longtime advocate of improving our nations infrastructure  Shuster was encouraged by this announcement Unfortunately  the Democrats in Congress  led by Speaker  Nancy  Pelosi  squandered this historic opportunity to create jobs and strengthen the backbone of our economy in order to fund 40 years of pent up liberal pet projects In November  the Blairsville  Pa  Dispatch reported that Shuster attended a ceremonial groundbreaking for a new facility at a sewage treatment plant in Blairsville According to the newspaper  the  121 million project was funded in part by federal stimulus money    Rep Phil Gingrey of Georgia In a Feb 13  2009  news release  Gingrey  a four term congressman  explained his vote by saying that thisstimulus bill only perpetuates the dangerous myth that government spending will fix this economy  The truth is government spending will only bury future generations in more debt In October  a photograph in the Cedartown  Ga  Standard showed Gingrey handing over a giant  ceremonial check for  625 000 in stimulus money to municipal leaders The money was to pay for new sidewalks  landscaping and other improvements to the downtown area  according to the newspaper A Gingrey spokeswoman told the Standard that because the project qualified for federal stimulus funds as shovel ready  Gingrey presented the proposal at the federal level City commissioner Scott Tillery described Gingrey to the newspaper as our point man when we need action from the federal government His staff is always interested and involved in local concerns  and the congressman will use his influence to make a case for his constituents    Sen Richard Burr of North Carolina Burr voted against the stimulus yet appeared in person to present a  2 million plus stimulus grant to help build a fire station to house the Bethlehem Community Volunteer Fire Department This is a great thing for this county  Burr said  according to the Hickory  NC  Daily Record Were not accustomed to federal dollars in that magnitude finding their way to North Carolina A spokesman for Burr told the Associated Press in October that he wasnt taking credit for the money Sen Burr was invited to the grant presentation by the Alexander County commissioners and was happy to be there to recognize the community and the fire department for their work in securing this highly competitive grant  the spokesman said In an interview with Politico  Burr added   Just because I voted against the stimulus doesnt mean I shouldnt recognize the merit achievement of an entity  None of the four House members cited above responded to a query from PolitiFact But the spokesman for one senior Republican lawmaker    House Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia    did return our call He argued that the Democratic criticism is overblown Cantor  a leading stimulus opponent  has taken heat from Democrats for organizing a job fair whose participating employers benefited from stimulus funding  as well as for helping local officials lobby for stimulus money to support a high speed rail link between Washington  DC  and Richmond  Va Brad Dayspring  Cantors spokesman  defended both efforts  saying that  in the first case  the congressman was simply trying to help his unemployed constituents get back to work  and  in the second case  he was continuing his longstanding efforts to boost high speed rail Cantors advocacy on the rail issue dates back a decade  to his tenure in the Virginia legislature On the broader question of why Cantor opted not to support the bill  Dayspring said that the congressman made his decision based on his opposition to the vast majority of the bills provisions The bill was so flawed  he voted against it despite his overwhelming support for the rail provision  Dayspring said If you support 1 percent of a bill and oppose 99 percent  are you expected to vote for it? Lets return to Obamas claim The president said that Republicans who voted against the stimulus have been all too happy to claim credit for Recovery Act projects and the jobs those projects have produced We found at least two lawmakers    Young and Davis    who aggressively criticized the stimulus bill yet sent out a news release touting their own role in helping constituents benefit from the bill In the meantime  Obama also said that some opponents of the stimulus have come to the ribbon cuttings for projects funded by the bill Shuster  Gingrey and Burr clearly attended such ceremonies To us  five clear cases are enough to validate the presidents assertion that some stimulus opponents have found a way to have their cake and vote against it  too,1,0,1535,real

President Barack Obamas old Illinois US senate seat features enough negative attacks to keep an army of fact checkers busy Democrat Alexi Giannoulias go to dig has been numerous misstatements made by his Republican rival  US Rep Mark Kirk  about his military record An ad entitled On and On from the Giannoulias campaign hits on a number of them rapid fire    splicing Kirks words with TV news commentary and print media reports calling Kirk out for misstatements The idea is to paint Kirk as a typical Washington politician who cannot be trusted Kirk has copped to misspeaking and being careless with facts about his military records Well discuss each of the misstatements cited in the Giannoulias ad briefly before delving more deeply into one of the most recent and controversial claims in the ad  that  He  Kirk  did violate Pentagon rules  twice actually  for improperly mingling politics with his military service Before we get started  though  heres a little on Kirks military history He has served in the Naval Reserve for 21 years as an intelligence officer  and currently holds the rank of commander In 1999  Kirk was called into active duty and deployed to Aviano  Italy  in support of Operation Allied Force  the war in Kosovo He was the team leader for an ad hoc intelligence team used to support air combat operations during Kosovo Commanding officers raved about his phenomenal performance and described Kirk as a natural and charismatic leader and head and shoulders above any intelligence officer I have ever met Elected to Congress in 2001  Kirk has continued his military service  which included two two week training stints in Afghanistan  in late 2008 and 2009 According to Navy records  Kirk has been awarded two Navy Marine Corps Commendation Medals  a Joint Meritorious Unit Award  Navy Unit Commendation  Meritorious Unit Commendation  a National Defense Service Medal  a Navy E Ribbon and a Global War on Terrorism Service Medal For this item we are going to do a Truth O Meter ruling on Giannoulias claim that Kirk did violate Pentagon rules  twice actually  for improperly mingling politics with his military service But before we get to that part of the ad  were going to examine other quotes from Kirk that Giannoulias also uses in the ad I was the Navys Intelligence Officer of the Year This is perhaps the highest profile of the military gaffes by Kirk  one he boasted about both on his resume and on the floor of Congress He didnt win that award Rather  in 2000  the National Military Intelligence Association awarded the intelligence unit led by Kirk with the Vice Admiral Rufus L Taylor Navy Reserve Intelligence Award  which honors exceptional achievement by outstanding intelligence professionals And Kirk was tapped to physically accept the award at the National Military Intelligence Associations annual awards banquet Kirk has since acknowledged that he incorrectly referred to himself as the  Intelligence Officer of the Year Most importantly  I wasnt thinking  Kirk said in a press conference This was a carelessness that did not reflect well upon me I served in Iraq and Afghanistan At other times  Kirk or his campaign literature have described him as a veteran of Operation Desert Storm and Operation Enduring Freedom He actually served as an intelligence officer stateside in Maryland as a reservist during both operations The Kirk campaign later changed his record to read that he served during the operations And again  his service in Afghanistan consisted of two two week training sessions The last time I was in Iraq  I was in uniform flying and the Iraqi air defense network was shooting at us In 2000  Kirk trained with a squadron based in Turkey  and flew over Iraq as part of Operation Northern Watch  enforcing a no fly zone in the northern part of the country In a June 4  2010 interview with the Chicago Sun Times  Kirk later clarified that while he heard reports of enemy fire  he cannot be sure his plane was ever fired on in Iraq or Kosovo I want to be very contrite and say there is a casualness with which I sometimes describe military details  Kirk told the Sun Times And if it gave the impression that my military record is larger than it was  I want to apologize I command the war room in the Pentagon Another misstatement According to the Chicago Sun Times  and acknowledged in an interview with Kirk  he commands one of two rooms    the intelligence unit    for eight hours at a time on his once a month weekend Naval reserve duties Kirk told the newspaper he misspoke as he was trying to explain that to a civilian audience But our ruling here is on this claim by Giannoulias  He did violate Pentagon rules  twice actually  for improperly mingling politics with his military service This was an issue first brought to light by blogger Terry Welch  who posted a Dec 18  2009  memo from Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Gail McGinn approving an exception to allow Kirk to train in Afghanistan The memo contained this intriguing concluding paragraph  As a candidate for the vacant Senate seat in Illinois  Commander Kirk must complete the appropriate acknowledgment of limitations required for all candidates on active duty  Ordinarily this acknowledgment must be completed within 15 days of entering active duty Because of the short period of active duty and concerns arising from his partisan political activities during his last two tours of active duty  Commander Kirk must complete this form prior to his entry on active duty Kirk campaign spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski released a statement  Mark Kirk has served our nation in the US Navy for two decades and has done so honorably The fact is  Congressman Kirk never violated Defense Department policies He has misspoken about his record  acknowledged it and apologized Mark Kirk left for Afghanistan and he did not engage in political activities    even in the face of radio commercials accusing him of being gay The memorandum in question is simply off the mark Furthermore  this raises grave concerns and questions about who gained access to Kirks confidential records The document in question should be viewed for what it is    a baseless political ploy by partisans bent on defending a US Senate seat at any cost The Pentagon  however  later clarified  saying that on two occasions  Kirk was counseled about violating military policy regarding getting involved in politics while on active duty  and that Kirk was required to sign a statement acknowledging he knew the rules and wouldnt break them again  the AP reported Specifically  the Pentagon said Kirk gave video interviews in late 2008 about Illinois Gov Rod Blagojevich being arrested And in July 2009  Kirk or a staff member wrote on the candidates Twitter account that he was on duty at the Pentagons National Military Command Center According to a Department of Defense directive on political activities by members of the Armed Forces  In keeping with the traditional concept that members on active duty should not engage in partisan political activity  and that members not on active duty should avoid inferences that their political activities imply or appear to imply official sponsorship  approval  or endorsement Specifically  the rules say that a member of the Armed Forces on active duty shall not  participate in any radio  television  or other program or group discussion as an advocate for or against a partisan political party  candidate  or cause According to AP coverage of a Kirk press conference published on June 30  2010  As Kirk apologized  for some of his misstatements about his military record   however  he also acknowledged something his campaign had flatly denied just two weeks ago   that he was twice scolded by the Pentagon for improperly mingling politics with his military duties He stopped short of acknowledging that he had actually violated military policy  though The Giannoulias ad states  He  Kirk  did violate Pentagon rules  twice actually  for improperly mingling politics with his military service The Pentagon released a statement to AP saying that Kirk was twice counseled for mixing politics with military service And we have a memo from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense referring to concerns arising from his partisan political activities during his last two tours of active duty The fact that Kirk was merely counseled suggests these were not deemed terribly egregious violations of military policy But the Pentagon did tell AP that Kirk signed a statement acknowledging that he knew the rules and wouldnt break them again You dont sign such a statement if you arent deemed to have skirted the rules We rule this claim True,0,0,1436,real

Because of the expense,During a recent appearance on The Daily Show   guest host John Oliver and Sen Rand Paul  R Ky  engaged in a lively exchange on health insurance One of the issues they discussed was the high cost of health insurance Paul  an eye surgeon  is strongly opposed to President Barack Obamas health care law During the interview  Oliver pressed him on how to get more Americans signed up for insurance Paul told Oliver that according to the most recent statistics   85 percent of people had insurance  so 15 percent didnt So what you need to do is look at who are the 15 percent  and why dont they have insurance? Of the 15 percent who didnt have insurance  half of them made more than  50 000 a year Why didnt they buy insurance? Because of the expense They were young healthy people In this fact check  well check whether the cost of insurance is the biggest barrier to uninsured Americans In a separate report  well look at his claim that half of the uninsured made more than  50 000 a year Survey data consistently shows that cost is the biggest barrier to uninsured Americans obtaining coverage When the Kaiser Family Foundations June 2013 health tracking poll asked uninsured respondents for the main reason they didnt have health insurance  a plurality of 40 percent cited cost The second biggest factor  at 26 percent  was related to employment  such as being unemployed or having a job that doesnt offer health insurance These two reasons arent mutually exclusive    someone could have told the pollster that their lack of a job was the biggest reason but also find cost to be a barrier to obtaining insurance The only answer in the poll that suggests the respondent doesnt face a cost obstacle is doesnt need insurance  which was the answer of only 11 percent In another survey  the 2011 National Health Interview Survey   conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  researchers asked  Which of these are reasons you stopped being covered or dont have health insurance? Respondents were allowed to choose more than one reason In this survey  too  a plurality    42 percent    cited cost Three other reasons cited are compatible with cost being an obstacle    a lost job or a change in employment  26 percent   an employer that didnt offer insurance  11 percent  and ineligible due to age or leaving school  9 percent  Just 6 percent cited other  which included didnt want or need coverage  among other answers The cost of insurance is a major reason why people are uninsured    Sen Paul is right about that  said Jonathan Oberlander  a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine People without access to employer sponsored coverage have a hard time affording it on their own  and that accounts for most of the uninsured,3,0,473,real

Pres Obamas tax spend  policy is quite The Situation but I do rec wearing sunscreen! We should hope so  McCain has a history of battling skin cancer But lets get to the facts Did President Barack Obama put a 10 percent  tax on tanning? On March 23  2010  Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  aka  the health care bill  into law And Chapter 49  SEC 5000B makes this all very  clear  There is hereby imposed on any indoor tanning service a tax equal to 10  percent of the amount paid for such service We were pretty sure Snooki was kidding about Obama  passing that provision specifically to stymie the Jersey Shore crew But it turns out that  the president had mentioned her by name on May 2  2010  and said shed be exempt   This next provision is called the Jersey Shore Up  Obama said It reads  The  following individuals shall be excluded from the indoor tanning tax within this  bill  Snooki  J WOWW  the Situation  and House Minority Leader John Boehner   The Situation and JWOWW are other members of the Jersey Shore cast  Alas  Obamas comment  was made during the White House Correspondents Association Dinner  In  other words  it was a joke  Yes  it scares us too that Obama and McCain are  so familiar with Jersey Shore  If we really wanted to pick a fight with Snooki  we  could take issue with her saying it was a tax on tanning Theres no fee on  sunshine  just indoor tanning Or that its Obamas tax Theres no indication  an indoor tanning tax was Obamas idea It was proposed by Senate Democrats in December as an  alternative to a proposed tax on cosmetic surgery The cosmetic surgery lobby   funded by plastic surgeons  apparently held more sway than the indoor tanning  lobby The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation projected the tax will  raise  27 billion over 10 years to help offset the cost of expanding medical  coverage Legislators said they also hoped it might discourage teens from indoor  tanning  as some studies suggest it is linked to higher risk of cancer The bill  was passed by Congress  but Obama signed it  so we think Snookis assigning the  tax to Obama is fair One other small point The indoor tanning tax goes  into effect on July 1  2010 So when Snooki made her comment  she still couldve  gotten her tan on sans Uncle Sams extra reach But were assuming Snooki isnt  so much worried about the money as the principle,1,2,514,real

It is up to Congress to identify which  cases should go to the Court via appeal  Mark Tushnet  a professor at  Harvard Law School  wrote to us in an e mail So  basically  Senator  Specters right Congress cant look around and  say  Heres one particular case you have to decide on the merits   Tushnet added They do have to act in general terms Specter  claimed that Congress can tell the Supreme Court which cases it must  hear According to the Constitution  Congress has the authority to do  just that  it can write legislation that gives the court appellate  jurisdiction over certain cases  as it did when it passed the Voting  Rights Act However  our experts said Congress cannot tell the Court  that is must hear a specific case,1,0,662,real

Its because we dont have somebody on the ground who can identify  a moving target  We found in Vietnam that if you dont have the right strategy  airpower is minimal in its effect We wondered whether its correct that 75 percent of combat airstrike missions return to base without having fired a weapon When we checked with the senators staff  they said that McCain    who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee    was basing his claim on data he was given by the US Central Command  or CENTCOM  the part of the military that oversees activities the region where the airstrikes are being carried out The data McCains staff had at the time of his appearance on Face the Nation showed that through the end of March  there had been 2 950 strikes out of 12 121 strike sorties  or 24 percent That leaves 75 percent of sorties that had no strikes  Strike sorties do not include support flights  such as those for surveillance or tanker refuelings  We double checked with the Pentagon  and two officials said that McCain got his numbers right As of May 27  2015  the United States had flown approximately 15 600 strike sorties resulting in approximately 4 198 strikes  said Cmdr Elissa Smith  a spokeswoman with the Office of the Secretary of Defense That works out to 27 percent    slightly higher than the data McCain had  but close enough for our purposes Pentagon officials told PolitiFact that there was nothing unusual or surprising about that ratio The fact that aircraft go on missions and dont strike anything is not out of the norm  said Air Force Capt Andrew Ender Caulk of Air Forces Central Command Public Affairs Despite US strikes being the most precise in the history of warfare  Caulk said  conducting strike operations in the heavily populated areas where DAESH hides presents challenges We are fighting an enemy who goes out of their way to put civilians at risk However  the vast majority of pilots understand the need for the tactical patience in this environment This fight against DAESH is not the kind of fight from previous decades Caulk added that if the United States engaged the way some of these critics want us to  we would be operating in violation of agreements established between the coalition nations and Iraq and putting civilians and Iraqi forces at greater risk The bottom line  We will not stoop to the level of our enemy and put civilians more in harms way than absolutely necessary,2,0,569,real

Actually  it has To determine job creation in the auto sector  we need to combine the figures for two separate categories of jobs One is  motor vehicles and parts manufacturing   and the other is  motor vehicle and parts dealers  Between December 2009 and December 2014  the number of jobs in the manufacturing category rose by 230 700  from 653 300 to 884 000  Over the same period  the number of jobs in the dealer category rose by 272 200  from 1 616 800 to 1 889 000  When you put those two categories together  the total increase in jobs over the past five years is 502 900    almost exactly what Obama said Its worth noting that this comeback hasnt brought automotive industry employment back to its pre recession levels The recent pre recession peak for these two job categories    in February 2005    was 303 million So despite the gains over the past five years  employment in the automotive industry is still down 9 percent from where it was a decade ago Well also note that PolitiFacts policy is to consider not just whether a statement is statistically accurate  but also whether the politician or party in question seems to be claiming credit or assigning blame  and if so  whether that credit or blame is deserved In this case  its unclear whether Obama is taking credit for the automotive industry job growth  but even if he is  experts have told us that Obamas leadership was crucial  along with help from some Republicans  in helping get the industry back on its feet So we wont be downgrading the accuracy of this comment on that basis,1,0,487,real

Its true that a substantial chunk of the stimulus is targeted to education US Education Secretary Arne Duncan said in this press release that the bill provides more than  100 billion in education funding and college grants and tuition tax credits  as well as billions more for school modernization This chart from the Wall Street Journal indicates  115 billion of the  787 billion goes to education in one way or another That includes  among other things   22 billion for school construction and repair   41 billion for states to balance education budgets   650 million for computer and science labs   17 billion for Pell Grants  and  14 million for Education Department spending oversight  which we dare say seems like money well spent in light of what precedes it  That money will be spent over the next two years  a spokesman told us For Obama to even be in the ballpark of being the largest ever  we have to assume that he was comparing the funding to prior spending by the   federal  government exclusively Its important to realize that the vast majority of money spent on education in this country is spent by states and localities Of the money spent at the elementary and secondary level  over 91 percent comes from nonfederal sources  according to the Education Department Even  115 billion wont change that balance substantially So well assume that Obama meant the largest single investment by the federal government As we look back on the history of federal education funding  we find no single effort comes close  even after adjusting for inflation The New Deal contained little in the way of education spending After the Soviet Union succeeded in placing the   Sputnik 1  satellite in orbit  President Dwight D Eisenhower signed the National Defense Education Act in 1958 to bolster math and science education   but that was a modest program by todays standards Lyndon B Johnson dramatically increased federal support for education with the Great Society programs  persuading Congress to pass the Elementary and Secondary School Act of 1965  the Higher Education Facilities Act of 1965 and Project Head Start Those efforts marked a turning point in federal support for education  but experts in education budgeting told us they received just a few billion dollars   very little compared to todays education spending  even before the stimulus For example  the Elementary and Secondary School Act was funded with  13 billion initially  according to the book   Depression to Cold War    which amounts to around  9 billion in current dollars Head Start received less than  1 billion These programs have grown over time  so that the real competition to Obamas stimulus spending  several experts said  comes from the Education Departments annual budget from recent years As this chart shows  it has risen steadily over the past 30 years  from  131 billion in 1980  in 2007 dollars  to  232 billion in 1990 to  341 billion in 2000 to  73 billion in 2007 Tom Skelly  director of budget service at the Education Department  said via e mail that the stimulus money is in addition to our 2009 regular appropriation that will be over  59 billion So in the department alone  we will have about  160 billion in discretionary appropriations Thats far higher than the departments budget has ever been Other departments in the federal government also spend money on education through scholarship programs  school lunches and the like  amounting to total federal spending of about  170 billion a year But theres no reason to believe those other programs wont continue this year as well  pushing total federal education spending to new heights It is the largest federal investment in education  Skelly wrote of the stimulus money  standing behind Obamas claim It does appear that the stimulus money will push federal spending on education   both within the Education Department and across the federal government as a whole   higher than it has ever been,1,0,716,real

President Trump makes English the official language of the United States! the headline reads Its obvious in the story that follows  which discusses changes on the White House website  that something was lost in translation We first saw the headline on DonaldTrumpPOTUS45com on Jan 26  2017   but it has appeared on other sites in subsequent days  Facebook flagged the story as part of its efforts to combat fake news in user feeds First off  English may be the de facto language of the United States  but the country has no designated official language A majority of states do have laws making English their official language  albeit to varying degrees Trump also did not elevate English in any official capacity  although he has certainly made it clear he would prefer citizens  including fluent Spanish speaker and former Florida Gov Jeb Bush   speak it Well  I think that when you get right down to it  were a nation that speaks English  Trump said at a 2015 news conference  I think that  while were in this nation  we should be speaking English This is a prime example of a certain type of fake news story that spins news of a real event  then slaps a provocative and largely unrelated headline on it in an attempt to draw eyeballs In this case  the body of the story clearly advocates for adopting English as an official language  and says Trump should do so But the only news event alluded to is about the official White House website losing its Spanish translation after Trump was inaugurated The post cites an article from the Los Angeles Times  which points out the translation option had been removed from WhiteHousegov on Jan 20  As of Feb 9  the Spanish translation of the White House website was still gone The story making the rounds on the Internet  meanwhile  says Trump purposely directed his administration to remove the translation Even if that were true   and theres no solid evidence thats the case   its far from making English the nations official language That would require legislation through Congress  which has been proposed in the past but never became law This incendiary headline woefully misrepresents the actual event to which it is tied,0,2,394,fake

We wondered whether the bishops support for comprehensive health care really goes back nearly a century Experts pointed us to the history of the National Catholic Welfare Council  the predecessor of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops The council held an annual meeting in which US bishops discussed national policy issues such as education  welfare and health care During the February 1919  meeting  held just after World War I  a group of bishops  led by a Catholic social reformer  Father John A Ryan   published the Bishops Program of Social Reconstruction  a guide to overhauling US social justice  Dolan was referring to a  section on social insurance   his spokesman said The state  the guide read  should make comprehensive provision for insurance against illness  invalidity  unemployment  and old age That wasnt the last time the USCCB has supported health care expansions For example  the group has publicly supported a variety of proposals  including former President Bill Clintons ultimately defeated health care plan in 1993 The flap is over the  contraception  issue  said Maria Mazzenga  a Catholic history archivist at The Catholic University of America Thats where it comes to appear that theyre against universal health care Mazzenga said that  despite opposition to one specific part of Obamacare  all but the most conservative bishops have consistently supported health care efforts over the years,1,0,441,real

Tapper asked Because Republicans are saying hes  not including them in this Clinton began by explaining that he faced a  different political environment Well  I think for one thing  I had to do a  little more of that  reaching out to Republicans  because I never had a  filibuster proof Senate  Clinton said And now there are 41 of them  although  I think that a lot of those who come from more progressive states  the two Maine  senators  the new senator from Massachusetts  a lot of them may think they  already gave it the store on the health care deal or whatever theyre doing on  financial reform I think it will be very difficult to just outright block a  Supreme Court nominee thats otherwise qualified With the close votes on health  care reform  we have all become a little more familiar with how important  political ratios can be to the legislative process And so we decided to do a  little research into Clintons claim that he never had a filibuster proof  Senate A filibuster is an attempt by the minority party to try to block  a vote on issue It takes a three fifths majority  60 out of 100 senators  to  invoke cloture and overcome a filibuster Thats why Scott Browns election to  the Senate in Massachusetts was such an important victory for Republicans It  gave Republicans 41 votes  enough to at least threaten a filibuster When  Clinton came into office in 1993  Democrats held the majority in the Senate But  the ratio was not filibuster proof Senate records show Republicans held 43 seats when Clinton came  into office  and they added another seat in June of that year with the election  of Kay Bailey Hutchison  R Texas That was the Senate breakdown when Clinton  nominated Ginsburg on June 14  1993  when she was confirmed by a 96 3  vote And it was the same ratio  56 Democrats to 44 Republicans  when Clinton  nominated Stephen Breyer the following year  he was confirmed  87 9  That would be as close as Clinton would ever come to a  filibuster proof Senate In fact  Republicans won a majority of seats in  the Senate in the 1994 elections and retained control of both houses throughout  the remainder of Clintons presidency The party split resurfaced later in the interview when Tapper asked  Clinton a nearly identical question to one Tapper posed a week earlier to  Clintons wife  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton  who championed the health  care reform bill in 1993 and 1994 Both were asked if they felt that because  they had stormed the castle on health care back in 1993  they had paved the  way for for Obama to succeed Hillary Clinton said she did not feel that  way   only that she was delighted it passed and that it was a long time coming Bill Clinton said he absolutely did feel that way Clinton said  his health plan ultimately failed because  We couldnt pass it without five or  six Republicans I had an obstacle President Obama didnt have They had an  absolute  clear filibuster number That is  they had 45 Republican senators  They could have lost four and still defeated me We note that Democrats  at the time were also more fractured on which health care plan to support But  Clinton is right that Republicans opposed his health care bill and clearly held  enough seats to attempt a filibuster in the Senate It never got to  that Still  that is one issue where Clinton had difficulty because he lacked a filibuster proof majority  whereas Obama did have that advantage  at least for his first year ,1,0,686,real

Kenneth Medlock  an economics professor at Rice University who serves as the senior director for the Center for Energy Studies  said there are a couple of reasons why production exceeds imports Yes  we are producing more than we import now  but that owes to both increased production domestically and reduced demand Medlock said The reduced demand is due in part to the recession Its no surprise that people cut back on gasoline consumption when theres less money in their wallets  so that lowers demand And if demand is down  the United States doesnt need to import as much oil supply Another cause of reduced demand is increased energy efficiency Over the last few years  rising popularity of fuel efficient vehicles and other innovations have led consumers and businesses to spend less on utilities and at the pump  said John Lowe  a senior associate dean and energy law professor at Southern Methodist University Aside from reduced demand  Medlock also mentioned increased production as another reason the United States is producing more oil than its importing We can credit increased domestic production to innovation in regulatory infrastructure That includes factors like the ability for companies to negotiate directly with private landowners about mineral rights  as well as open access to pipelines But we cant tie these developments back to one president  Medlock said They go back a couple of decades Still  its worth noting that Obama is a known supporter of energy efficiency When he campaigned for office  he promised to reduce the countrys dependency on foreign oil In 2012  we rated that Promise Kept based on projections of the impact of his administrations fuel efficiency standards,1,0,487,real

Trump wrote The false story said Trumps tweet coincided with a California mans guilty plea in relation to a murder threat delivered to Waters The plea   entered by Anthony Scott Lloyd  45  of San Pedro  California   proved that the presidents hate mongering towards Waters has real life consequences  the story said The story erred in getting details and timing of real incidents wrong A man by the name of Anthony Scott Lloyd did  in fact  plead guilty to threatening a United States official Lloyd phoned Waters office on Oct 22  2017  and left a voicemail riddled with derogatory language  including racial epithets and expletives The message used the words dead and kill a total of four times  according to a press release from the Department of Justice If you continue to make threats towards the president  youre going to wind up dead  Maxine  cause well kill you  Lloyd said  according to court documents If you do it again  youre dead  We obtained a digital copy of the plea agreement  which included a full transcript of the voicemail  from Thom Mrozek  spokesperson for the United States Attorneys Office Central District of California  But Lloyd plead guilty on April 16  2018  and Trump tweeted at Waters more than two months later on June 25  2018 So it is not true that the two events occurred on the same day  as the false headline suggested The headline is likely not the result of confusion  either  because no reports related to Lloyds case were released on the day of Trumps tweet Lloyds sentencing date is set for July 16  2018  and Mrozek said there have not been any new developments in the case since the guilty plea Plus  Lloyd only plead guilty to threatening Waters He was not charged with trying to murder the congresswoman Mrozek said prosecutors have not made any allegations related to an actual attempt at murder The Washington Press did not respond to a request for comment,0,1,535,fake

Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated  as part of the social networks efforts to combat fake news There is no evidence that Obama is poised to be indicted or that he wiretapped Trump A similar  shorter version of this story appeared on freedomnewscentercom in September and follows a pattern of fake news stories over the past year that said that Obama wiretapped Trumps phones during the election Some photos included a doctored photo of Obama in handcuffs in court  On March 4  2017  Trump tweeted that Obama ordered surveillance on him during the election As we explained following his tweets   its possible the Trump White House is privy to investigative activities that arent in the public record However  it appeared more likely that Trump took several media reports about legitimate intelligence investigations into his associates possible Russia ties and wove them into a new  unsubstantiated theory that Obama himself did something illegal The  New York Times and  Washington Post  reported   based on anonymous sources   that FBI Director James Comey asked the Justice Department to publicly refute Trumps tweets because they wrongly imply the FBI broke the law Additionally  an Obama spokesman has categorically denied that the Obama White House ordered any wiretapping The Global Headlines story focused on comments by former CIA analyst and retired Army Lt Col Tony Shaffer  who was interviewed following Trumps tweets Shaffer  who is frequently interviewed on Fox News and works for the conservative London Center for Policy Research  told  Newsweek  in 2016 that the incoming Trump administration asked him to apply for a job The Global Headlines mentioned a recent interview by Shaffer on the radio show Trending Today USA  but that interview was actually 11 months ago The interviewer asked Shaffer if Obama should be arrested  This could be first time a former president could be indicted for a felony  because I think that its very possible that he acted outside the scope of his duties  responsibilities and authorities to turn the resources of a nations state on a candidate  he said in a clip of the interview This is  as I said before  Soviet dictator level wrongdoing There is no evidence that Obama himself ordered wiretapping to spy on Trump during the election and is now headed toward an indictment Trump tweeted in 2017 that Obama had ordered surveillance on him While there have been media reports about intelligence investigations into Trumps associates possible Russia ties  there is no proof that Obama himself ordered wiretapping of Trump,0,1,514,fake

Its hard to say There has been much debate about the costs  and its been difficult to come up with a reliable number because the bills have been changing as they move through the House and the Senate Republicans have cited numbers as high as  3 000 per year  a claim that when it was combined with a falsehood on health care  earned our Pants on Fire rating Recent estimates by the Congressional Budget Office and the Environmental Protection Agency are much lower   between  80 and  340 a year  depending on income So the climate debate has changed substantially since Obama sat down with the  Chronicle  nearly two years ago Despite those potential cost cuts  theres still little disagreement that consumers will pay for cap and trade  whether its  3 100 a year or  340 Because that hasnt changed since Obama first said that utility rates would necessarily skyrocket  and because Palin got Obamas words right  we give Palin a True,1,0,594,real

At 65 His point was that Social Security was not meant to benefit as many people as it does today Indeed  Beck went on to say that if Roosevelt had passed the law now  the starting age would be around 80 years old  due to longer life expectancy We wondered if Beck was right about life expectancy in the 1930s Indeed  he was correct The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  a federal agency that tracks birth and death data  says that a man born in 1935  on average  lived until he was 60  a woman typically lived until she was 64 So Becks claims of 58 and 62 were just off slightly And Beck was correct that an average person would die before Social Security took effect What about Becks implication that the age was chosen purposefully so that the majority of Americans would never recieve their Social Security benefits? Was FDR making this calculation? Probably not  said Edward Berkowitz  a professor on Public Policy at the George Washington University and author of several books on Social Security I think that the age was chosen somewhat at random  certainly not to hedge actuarial bets Berkowitz thought that an alternative explanation for the age choice was that the Germans had a similar program that the Americans used as a model Berkowitz also pointed out that the median age might not reflect real life expectancy because the number was skewed by a large share of infant deaths After you survive infancy  life expectancy goes up Of course  we cant be sure what FDR was thinking  but for our purposes  Becks statement is off by just a couple of years and his overall point is right that life expectancy was below the retirement age of 65 Thats close enough to earn a True,3,0,374,real

Kenneth Medlock  an economics professor at Rice University who serves as the senior director for the Center for Energy Studies  said there are a couple of reasons why production exceeds imports Yes  we are producing more than we import now  but that owes to both increased production domestically and reduced demand Medlock said The reduced demand is due in part to the recession Its no surprise that people cut back on gasoline consumption when theres less money in their wallets  so that lowers demand And if demand is down  the United States doesnt need to import as much oil supply Another cause of reduced demand is increased energy efficiency Over the last few years  rising popularity of fuel efficient vehicles and other innovations have led consumers and businesses to spend less on utilities and at the pump  said John Lowe  a senior associate dean and energy law professor at Southern Methodist University Aside from reduced demand  Medlock also mentioned increased production as another reason the United States is producing more oil than its importing We can credit increased domestic production to innovation in regulatory infrastructure That includes factors like the ability for companies to negotiate directly with private landowners about mineral rights  as well as open access to pipelines But we cant tie these developments back to one president  Medlock said They go back a couple of decades Still  its worth noting that Obama is a known supporter of energy efficiency When he campaigned for office  he promised to reduce the countrys dependency on foreign oil In 2012  we rated that Promise Kept based on projections of the impact of his administrations fuel efficiency standards,1,0,482,real

Obama replied  You know   I am   I think mathematically  the White Sox can still get in the playoffs Here at PolitiFact  were focused more on the American League East  Go Rays!   so we had lost track of how the White Sox were doing in the AL Central We turned to our favorite baseball writer  Marc Topkin of the  St Petersburg Times    to find out if Obama was right Topkin told us that while the White Sox are out of the running to be the wild card team for the American League  its mathematically possible they could still win their division and then be in the playoffs As of Sunday morning when  Meet the Press  aired  the White Sox were 5 1 2 games behind the first place Detroit Tigers Topkin told us the White Sox wouldnt be mathematically eliminated until there were 6 games left  and going into today they have 13 left So Obama can hold out hope for at least another week or so The odds are against the Sox   they play the Tigers and the Minnesota Twins  the No 2 team in the division  in the next week And Topkin noted that a lot of things have to break in favor of the Sox But Obama is right that its at least mathematically possible  so he earns a True,1,1,325,real

Sadly  the answer  as we all know  is simply for money  money that is drenched in blood  often innocent blood The New York Evening News article had the pope talking about gun owners when he wasnt  and gun makers specifically when he was talking about the arms trade in general Plus  it made it sound as though he was speaking recently and in the context of the current debate over guns after the shootings in Parkland  Fla  when in reality  his speech was three years old Its just another example of fake news writers shooting from the hip,3,0,397,fake

Match up the number of agents in each of the two agencies The FBI has 13 766 special agents This means that once the amendments plan is carried out  the Border Patrol will have more than two and a half times as many agents on the southwestern border alone as the FBI does to investigate crimes anywhere in the world  And the Border Patrol is even bigger than that It assigned an additional 2 430 agents in 2012 to the northern border and coastal regions  and its parent agency  US Customs and Border Protection  has nearly 39 000 additional employees in the US and around the world  So  however you slice it  Mahers correct that the Border Patrol will be bigger than the FBI if the Senate bill is enacted You could put one  Border Patrol  agent every 250 feet According to the International Water and Boundary Commission    a bi national body that oversees governance issues on the US Mexico border    the border between the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico is is 1 954 miles long That works out to 1032 million feet Doing the math  you could space out 37 716 agents one every 274 feet  or  using the widely published 40 000 figure  you could put them every 258 feet  Either way  Mahers calculation strikes us as very close to accurate Needless to say  the Border Patrol wouldnt deploy their personnel in this fashion Not only do patrols work on shifts  but some agents are flying helicopters  some are escorting or guarding detainees and a good number are shoulder to shoulder at the major border cross points screening cars  searching for drugs But Mahers rhetorical point is well taken  The agency literally  if it wished  could place agents every 274 feet,1,0,626,real

Yes The most widely cited data comes from the US Census Bureau  which tabulates statistics annually on what percentage of Americans are covered by health insurance The most recent report came out in September 2016  covering the year 2015 The Census Bureau found that 909 percent of Americans had some type of health coverage  whether it was provided by their employer  purchased independently or through a government program such as Medicare or Medicaid The remainder    91 percent of Americans    were uninsured Heres the key table from the report  That was an improvement over the 896 percent in 2014  867 percent in 2013  846 percent in 2012   843 percent in 2011  and 837 percent in 2010    the year the Affordable Care Act was passed  although the law didnt start having a major impact for another few years Meanwhile  between 1999 and 2009  the insured rate bounced from a low of 839 percent to a high of 869 percent  the furthest back the Census Bureau offers the statistic online And at the time the 2015 data was released  it was framed as a record high for insurance coverage Looking at it the opposite way  the uninsured rate fell from 163 percent in 2010 to 91 percent in 2015    a decline of nearly half over five years,1,0,362,real

CBS News moderator Nancy Cordes asked Youve said before youd go above 50 percent How high? We havent come up with an exact number yet  but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D Eisenhower  which was 90 percent  Sanders answered Was the top income tax rate under Eisenhower an astronomical 90 percent? We decided to check the ledgers on that figure Before we go further  lets review what the marginal tax rate means Its the tax rate thats applied to the last dollar earned The US tax system is based on brackets The top marginal tax rate applies to the highest bracket Income is taxed at higher rates as more is earned We turned to the Tax Foundations federal income tax rates history   which documents figures going all the way back to 1913  when the income tax began with the ratification of the 16th Amendment During the eight years of the Eisenhower presidency  from 1953 to 1961  the top marginal rate was 91 percent  It was 92 percent the year he came into office  What does it mean  though? For the duration of Eisenhowers presidency  that rate affected individuals making  200 000 or more per year or couples making  400 000 and above per year In 2015 dollars  thats roughly  17 million for an individual and  34 million for a couple Today the tax brackets are adjusted for inflation  but are exceptionally lower than in Eisenhowers day The top rate in 2015 is 396 percent   applied to single people making  413 200 or more per year  or married couples filing jointly making  464 850 or more annually If we went back to 1954  single people making the equivalent of  413 200 would be in a 72 percent tax bracket  while a couple making  464 850 would end up in a 75 percent bracket Whats the highest income tax bracket ever put in place?

Its hard to say  the balance of evidence does not point to a harsh pivot point But when we balance her previous statements against her more recent statements  we find that she has changed her sentiments when she speaks about NAFTA,1,0,752,real

Do we need them to protect our families? she asked on air Cant we hold true the sanctity of the Second Amendment while still having common sense? These comments drew opposition from gun rights supporters Its at this point that the article veers off into fabrication The article reads  Interestingly  when confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter  Carlson doubled down on her pro ban stance  claiming thatthe fact that youre even using the Second Amendment as an argument against banning assault weapons shows me youre ignorant Dont you know the 2nd Amendment was written before guns were even invented?  This would be a ridiculous claim if shed actually said it As schoolchildren are taught  muskets were used in the American Revolution   Heres an example from the collection of the Museum of the American Revolution  And the revolution occurred more than a decade before the 1789 drafting and ratification of the Bill of Rights  which includes the Second Amendment   A well regulated militia  being necessary to the security of a free state  the right of the people to keep and bear arms  shall not be infringed   Indeed  the history of firearms goes back even further than that    to the 1300s  more than four centuries before the Second Amendment was written The first hint that this may be bogus appears elsewhere on therightistscom website On the sites  About Us  page  a grammatically challenged warning explains that therightistscom is independent News platform That allow People and independent Journalist to bring the news directly to the readers Readers come to us as a source of independent news that not effected from the big channels This is HYBRID site of news and satire part of our stories already happens  part  not yet NOT all of our stories are true!

In 2002  the United States established a detention camp on the 45 acre naval base on Cubas south east coast to hold suspects in the war on terror More than 750 people have been detained in total over the past 13 years  with 132 current detainees About 2 100 people work there So how much does it cost? For fiscal year 2014  the total cost of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility is  397 million  according to a Department of Defense report drafted for the Senate Intelligence Committee This includes money spent on maintenance  personnel  contracted work  military commissions and Department of Defense funded studies Spread out among the 155 people detained over the course of 2014  thats about  26 million per detainee In 2013  with a similar size budget but more detainees  the cost worked out to about  27 million per detainee For comparison  inmates at high security federal prisons cost about  34 000 per year on average  as of 2012  Part of the reason holding detainees at Guantanamo is so much more expensive than other prisons might be transportation costs  said Madeline Morris  a law professor and director of Duke Universitys Guantanamo Defense Clinic Most people  food and supplies have to be brought in by air  which is an enormous cost The number of detainees is going down  but the facility may face extra costs in the future In August 2014  the New York Times reported that an estimated  200 million in maintenance will be necessary in coming years to keep the detention facility functioning The infrastructure was originally built to be temporary One aspect of Guantanamo that doesnt cost very much is the land In 1903   then President Theodore Roosevelt secured the area from Cuba for  2 000 a year  paid in gold    worth about  4 085 today The American government continues to pay the rent each year  but the Cuban government reportedly refuses to cash the checks,2,0,464,real

According to CDC   there were 33 599 deaths caused by firearms in 2014 That includes homicides  suicides  legal interventions  accidents and cases of undetermined intentions So in 2014  there were indeed more overdose deaths  43 225  than there were deaths from firearms  33 599   making Pitts second claim correct,1,0,286,real

By the time she turns 3 years old  a child born into a low income home hears 30 million fewer words than a child from a well off family  which means by the time she starts school  shes already behind  he said Just for comparisons sake  30 million words would be equivalent to 4 615 Obama speeches But did he get his fact right? Wed never heard of this finding before  so we took a closer look When we asked the White House for a source  a spokesman pointed us to research from the mid 1990s and early 2000s by child psychologists Betty Hart and Todd Risley They published their findings in a book   Meaningful Differences in the Everyday Experience of Young American Children  Over several years  the pair observed families of different socioeconomic statuses  based on education and income levels  and found that better off families engaged their children more frequently with language They found a 30 million word gap by age 3 between students of divergent socioeconomic classes Thats one piece of evidence  they argued  to explain the achievement gap  a term educators and researchers have used to explain why lower income students start kindergarten on worse footing The word gap  along with other issues  leaves preschool educators to fix existing educational shortfalls  said Dana Suskind  a doctor and researcher at the University of Chicago Shes also the director of Thirty Million Words Initiative   one of many advocacy and research groups whose work revolves around the Hart and Risley research This early language and vocabulary gap are really the beginnings of the achievement gap that we see continuing on through the end of high school and through life  Suskind said Obama and others often bring up the concept of 30 million words because early childhood exposure to language comes at a crucial time in brain development  said Samuel Odom  a child development researcher at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill When asked if any scientist has called the 30 million word gap into question  Suskind told us its pretty well accepted as the norm in the field In addition  she and two other experts agreed that Obama had summed up the research accurately Suskind offered just one caveat  While Obama described the norm  theres variation from family to family Some low income families speak to and interact with their kids more  and some more affluent families dont No socioeconomic group has cornered the market on loving their kids and wanting their kids to succeed  she said You cant generalize economic groups,2,0,471,real

Whatever we say behind peoples backs   because the Internet can be a little bit ruthless as far as fan bases go   but I think that the greatest thing we can do is just unite and love on each other And no barriers  no borders   we all need to just co exist  Footnote  Perry later performed with Grande at a benefit concert for the Manchester victims  Some conservative commentators on social media mocked Perrys remarks as geopolitically naive  though they often did so without noting that Perry had been seeking to promote unity and respect between the fans of different singers  not trying to ideologically reconcile extreme Islamism with advanced democracy For instance  a Fox   Friends tweet touted commentator Michelle Malkins remark that Perrys call for no barriers  no borders typifies the liberal mindset of celebs who dont operate in reality Perry responded to Malkin through a pair of tweets   michellemalkin The media has edited my words out of context  I was talking about online fan culture and how we must unite now  Maybe didnt say it perfectly but  I dont always get it right Would love to speak with you in the future Either way  the story in the Babylon Bee reflects pretty obvious satire  not reality,1,0,631,fake

vote supermajority Democrats lost when Scott Brown of Massachusetts was elected to the Senate In other words  its an option some Democrats are mulling if a bipartisan plan cannot be achieved In the Republicans opening statement  Sen Lamar Alexander  R Tenn  said  You can say that this process has been used before  and that would be right But its never been used for anything like this Its not appropriate to use to write the rules for 17 percent of the economy Alexander quoted Alexis de Tocqueville that the greatest threat to the American democracy would be the tyranny of the majority Soon after  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of having a bit of amnesia on reconciliation No one has talked about reconciliation  but thats what you folks have talked about ever since that came out  as if its something that has never been done before  Reid said Now  we as leaders here  the speaker and I  have not talked about doing reconciliation as the only way out of all this Of course its not the only way out But remember  since 1981  reconciliation has been used 21 times Most of its been used by Republicans for major things  like much of the Contract for America  Medicare reform  the tax cuts for rich people in America So reconciliation isnt something thats never been done before Well set aside some of the hypocrisy here  see Reids comments in 2005 when he talked about the arrogance of power when Republicans were mulling reconciliation  Similarly  well set aside the hypocrisy of Republicans who used reconciliation in the past  but now denounce it The issue were looking at here is whether Republicans have really used reconciliation bills more than Democrats  as Reid claimed On Nov 14  2008  the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service put out a report on reconciliation bills between 1981 and 2009 There have been 22 of them  including three that were vetoed by President Bill Clinton Its been used for health insurance portability  COBRA   nursing home standards  expanded Medicaid eligibility  increases in the earned income tax credit  welfare reform  start up of the state Childrens Health Insurance Program  major tax cuts and student aid reform While some have tallied the Republican vs Democratic report card on reconciliation based on the president in power at the time  we think it makes more sense to look at the party in power in Congress when the reconciliation procedure was initiated By our count  eight of the reconciliation bills were initiated by a Democratic controlled Congress The rest  14  were done by a Republican controlled Congress So by that measure  Reid is on target Its a legitimate argument  said Thomas Mann  a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution And Reid is absolutely right It has been used a lot  and more by Republicans than Democrats On April 20  2009  Mann co authored an article in the New Republic  Truth and Reconciliation  Sidestepping the Filibuster  along with Molly Reynolds  also of Brookings  and Norman Ornstein  a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute  which concluded that Health reform 2009 style would be the most ambitious use of reconciliation but it fits a pattern used over three decades by both parties to avoid the strictures of Senate filibusters Still  we think looking at all 22 reconciliation bills casts too wide a net Many reconciliation bills were not even all that controversial  and enjoyed wide bipartisan support But other ones have clearly involved policy decisions that otherwise would likely have failed Only eight involved votes where the winning side had less than the supermajority threshold of 60 votes One could argue those were the times when Congress got around the need for the standard 60 votes But even among that smaller group  six of the eight came courtesy of a Republican controlled Congress By way of counterpoint  Brian Darling  director of Senate relations at the conservative Heritage Foundation  argues that any comparison of past reconciliation bills to one on health care is flawed This is a unique situation  Darling said Its completely unprecedented to use reconciliation to amend a bill that is pending in Congress but has not passed Darling called the Democrats threat of reconciliation a measure of last resort to steamroll through a bill that can no longer get 60 votes in the Senate and is unpopular with the American public Whether or not a reconciliation bill on health care meets the intent of the legislative procedure is certainly a matter for legitimate debate But Reid said reconciliation has been used 21 times since 1981  and that most of the time  its been Republicans who have initiated it,0,0,852,real

Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated  as part of the social networks efforts to curb fake news The same subject came up on other websites   as well  The NewsOfTrumpcom post didnt mention the charges in the headline  but specified in the text that she violated House rules by arranging a 2008 meeting between the Treasury Department and representatives of OneUnited bank   where her husband was a notable shareholder The post criticized Waters for being corrupt and said OneUnited directly benefitted from her actions As a member of the House Financial Committee  she was able to directly contact then Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to speak with him about meeting with minority owned banks  the post read Through her efforts  OneUnited bank was able to obtain  12 million in federal bailout funding to help cover expected losses from the collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac These posts describe real events  when the House ethics committee charged Waters with breaking three rules by allegedly trying to assist OneUnited  in which her husband did hold a sizeable share of stock But the flap over the OneUnited meeting happened in 2010  Reports surfaced in 2009 that Waters had allegedly helped OneUnited CEO Kevin Cohee secure a meeting to ask for  50 million in bailout funds to recover from the Great Recession  triggering a House ethics investigation  The bank did get  12 million   In August 2010  the panel recommended three charges against Waters for violating ethics rules that essentially are supposed to keep members of Congress from making the House look bad Her chief of staff  Mikael Moore  also was charged But the posts implied or outright said that Waters is currently facing charges  making it seem as if the House had only now acted on the 2008 meeting They also dont mention that the ethics charges against Waters were dropped in 2012  In contentious action between Republican and Democratic members of the committee  a lawyer hired specifically to review the case found that Waters believed she had been acting in the interest of all minority owned banks  not just OneUnited She had called for a meeting to help those banks  and ended her involvement when she learned OneUnited was part of the group Moore was given a letter of reproval for the incident   for not stopping Waters involvement once it was clear OneUnited was one of the banks asking for help Waters is a vocal critic of President Donald Trump  which no doubt was what has earned her the attention of fake news purveyors  who typically zero in on political flashpoints She recently earned criticism for saying she wanted to take Trump out and called him the most dishonorable and despicable human being to ever serve in the office of the president Although based on things that really happened  the fake news posts distort the timeline and leave out the final result of the House ethics committee investigation Someone reading it would be misinformed of the events,1,0,565,fake

Apparently  the answer is yes We did not hear back from either Boltons office or from Pauls office However  Pauls column included a link to his evidence Paul pointed to a Talking Points Memo article  which in turn referenced an article in the Washington Examiner  In the Examiner article  published on May 14  2015  senior congressional correspondent David Drucker quoted Bolton saying  I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct I think decisions made after that decision were wrong  although I think the worst decision made after that was the 2011 decision to withdraw US and coalition forces The people who say Oh  things would have been much better if you didnt overthrow Saddam  miss the point that todays Middle East does not flow totally and unchangeably from the decision to overthrow Saddam alone This supports Pauls assertion Before drawing a final conclusion  we looked at two additional questions First  did Bolton complain after the fact that the article misquoted him? We asked Drucker  who said  No  they never complained    him or his people And second  has Bolton said anything else since then that would make his comment in the Examiner interview outdated? The answer here seems to be no  as well We searched in both Google and Nexis and found no contrary comments by Bolton in the subsequent year and a half The only relevant quote we found in our searches was published on the same day as the Examiner article It was a blog post in the Washington Post that quoted Bolton saying  My answer would have been  If you knew everything you do today  of course youd make different choices  but Id still overthrow Saddam Hussein  who was a threat to peace and stability in the region  This only supports the gist of what Paul said,3,0,520,real

Well shed a little light on this claim Solar expansion Obamas claim came from Greentech Media  GTM   which published the statistic in August in its Solar Market Research Report  a project with the Solar Energy Industries Association GTM provides quarterly and annual reports that contain solar specific analysis and forecasts for industry professionals A GTM chart shows how solar installations have rapidly increased in recent years from one every 80 minutes in 2006 to one every four minutes in 2013 A lot happens in America every four minutes  wrote GTM in an August blog about their research During that short time period  30 babies are born   4 080 McDonalds Big Macs are consumed   and 48 000 tons of CO2 are emitted  And as it turns out  the US is now installing one solar photovoltaic  PV  system every four minutes as well If market growth continues at its current pace  the American solar industry could be installing a system every minute and twenty seconds by 2016 Every quarter GTM collects the number of solar installations from utilities and state agencies Researchers get data from 28 states  including Florida   which represents about 97 percent of the market and devise an estimate for the remaining states  said Shayle Kann  senior vice president of research GTM has been tracking the solar market since 2009 and collected this particular detailed data since 2010  Kann said that the US Energy Information Administration has some data on solar installations but not to the level of detail that GTM requires for quarterly reports  In 2013  there were about 132 000 installations  and there were 525 600 minutes  so the math works out to about one installation every four minutes GTM is finalizing the number of installations in 2013    GTM says its possible it could have been higher Part of the reason for the rapid growth is that the cost of solar panels and installation has dropped  Kann said Experts on alternative energy generally agreed with GTMs research but offered some caveats Solar is growing  but from a very small number  said Christopher Bronk  director of the Program on Energy and Cybersecurity at Rice University According to the  November electric power monthly report from the Energy Information Administration  PV solar energy accounts for about 15 percent of all electricity generated from renewable sources and 2 percent percent of all the electricity generated And not surprisingly  solar is more common in some states than others As you move to places with a lot more cloud cover  lets say Washington  DC  then solar energy isnt going to work as well  said Stephen PA Brown  an expert in energy economics at the University of Nevada Unless there is some huge change in technology its not projected to be the dominant form of energy any time soon or in fact ever,1,0,572,real

According to the CDC  nobody is quite sure Reasons for disparities are not well understood and are the subject of research by numerous investigators in university research centers  says a statement from the agencys Air Pollution and Respiratory Health Branch However  there are studies that provide a couple of clues For example  one examination of trends in preventive asthma medication use from 1988 to 2008 found that black and Mexican American children were less likely to use the medication than white children Another study from 1997 found that inner city children are more likely to develop allergies as a result of prolonged exposure to cockroach allergens Since minorities are more likely to live in urban areas  this may go some way toward explaining higher rates of asthma morbidity and mortality,1,0,652,real

In that fiscal year  according to the US Agency for International Development  the United States spent  449 billion  while overall government spending was  352 trillion Foreign aid spending was 128 percent of the total budget If youre wondering who else is a major US aid recipient  heres the rest of the top 10 from 2008  Russia   13 billion   Sudan   12 billion   Tanzania   11 billion   Ethiopia   1 billion   Pakistan   963 million   Colombia   888 million   Jordan   833 million   and Mozambique   799 million  The totals reflect both economic and military aid So Obama was almost exactly right in saying foreign aid consumes about 1 percent of the US budget In fiscal 2008 US foreign aid spending of  491 billion made up 164 percent of total spending The next year foreign aid spending was  449 billion  or 128 percent of the total budget,1,0,375,real

The answer is partly US law  said a Texas congressman on CNNs State of the Union on July 6  2014 Candy Crowley  CNNs host  asked Rep Henry Cuellar  D Texas  Why are they coming in such numbers? What do you think prompts these numbers right now? Cuellar answered  If youre a Mexican  you get sent back Mother  kids  adults  youre sent back  but if youre from a noncontiguous country like the Central American countries  then the law says that you are going to be held   and  Health and Human Services  theyre going to place you Thats the law that we need to change right now We looked into the claim and found that Cuellar wasnt crossing any lines With an influx of about 52 000 child immigrants at the border since October  the conversation has shifted to explanations Which brings us to the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008  Some have cited it as the catalyst for the increase in illegal immigration President George W Bush signed the law on Dec 23  2008  it received bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate as a measure to combat human trafficking worldwide The law was never intended to encourage mass immigration from noncontiguous countries But the laws Section 235 did change the policies and procedures for handling unaccompanied alien children Section 235  entitled Enhancing Efforts to Combat the Trafficking of Children  requires humane treatment of minors crossing the border from foreign nations It also mandates safe and secure placements  calling for careful consideration when placing unaccompanied minors in residences within the United States The law lays out one procedure for child immigrants from contiguous countries  like Mexico and Canada  and another for children from noncontiguous countries  like El Salvador or Honduras Child immigrants from contiguous countries are processed for immediate return to their home country In all other cases  the children are placed under the responsibility of the Secretary of Health and Human Services These children are placed with family or in other residences while they await their immigration court date Long story short  they get to stay in the United States The law seems to assume that alien children from noncontiguous countries were likely to be the victims of human trafficking  and it guarantees these minors access to legal counsel and child advocates Experts said Cuellar was right  and the law was never intended to allow immigrant children from Central America to remain in the United States Representative Cuellars characterization is mostly right  said Dan Cadman  a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies The law has actually fueled an industry in the smuggling of minors Contrary to intent  it has proven to be an inducement to wholesale smuggling of minors from noncontiguous countries The House GOP task force  assembled by speaker John Boehner to address the immigration crisis  issued a statement this week calling for changes to the law We agree with the president that  these children  must be returned to their home countries in the most humane way possible and that will require a revision of the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act On July 9  2014  Cuellar said that he is introducing legislation to make the repatriation of minors from noncontiguous countries easier and faster by revising the law,3,0,557,real

We looked at past Senate election results and found that Republicans have had some successful gains in the past 35 years  but many of those wins were in races for an open seat when a Democratic senator was retiring In 1980  Republicans took 12 Democrat Senate seats  nine incumbents lost in the general election  while three lost in their primaries  Spicer is correct to say they havent beat more than two incumbents since then We found a great chart showing Senate seat turnover for the past half century in the Brookings Institutions most recent  Vital Statistics on Congress  report  h t to Sabatos Crystal Ball   The arrows show when a Democratic  D  seat switched to a Republican  R  seat and vice versa From 1981 on  Republicans have beaten only 12 incumbent Democrats for Senate seats Republicans biggest Senate gains in that time frame all involve taking open seats    such as 1994  2004 and 2010  when they gained four  five and six open seats  respectively Senate Democrats havent had quite the same struggle against Republican incumbents in recent years Since 1981  theyve beaten 37 incumbents total  compared to Republicans 12 So if Republicans are able to beat more than two incumbent Democratic senators Tuesday  it would be a clear break with the recent past If Republicans take seven seats  both beating incumbents and taking open seats  which the New York Times election model has as the most likely outcome    that will be their second biggest overall gain since 1980 In 1994  Republicans won eight Senate seats    beating two incumbents and taking six open seats What made 1980 so special? In the same election   former President Ronald Reagan beat incumbent Democrat President Jimmy Carter Carter was fast falling out of favor with voters  considering the Iran hostage crisis  a floundering economy and other issues On top of Carters struggles  there was a major rift between Southern and Northern Democrats It was an extraordinary political environment that allowed Republicans to sweep the congressional elections Compare that to this years Senate elections where  although there is no presidential election  Republicans are using President Barack Obamas relatively low popularity to their advantage in races against incumbent Democrats,2,0,495,real

First  some background Using armed unmanned aerial vehicles in combat is controversial because it pushes legal boundaries  Heres a previous fact check in which we looked at this issue  Of special concern is that drones have killed at least four American citizens on foreign soil In defense of the program  officials often praise its effectiveness in hampering terrorist organizations Tallying up the number of drone strikes is challenging  for obvious reasons    they are done with tight secrecy Although breaking down this data is difficult to do as a layperson  experts we checked with suggest that the claim that US drone strikes have killed dozens of senior terrorists may well be an understatement Hillary Clintons statement is 100 percent correct  said Daveed Gartenstein Ross  a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies Thats a conservative estimate There are no definitive lists of drone strikes or casualties they cause  but an analysis by the New America Foundation  a think tank  found that as of 2013  drones have killed about 58 known militant leaders in Pakistan and 35 in Yemen In just those two countries  drones have killed between 2 861 and 4 452 people in all    civilians and unknowns  in addition to militants  according to the foundations study  Pakistan and Yemen are the locations of the majority of United States drone strikes  though attacks have also occurred in Libya  Afghanistan  Iraq  Somalia and Philippines  Clinton  though  uses the dozens number to refer to senior terrorists killed through 2009 A look through another non governmental database    created by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism   a philanthropically funded investigative journalism project based in the United Kingdom    appears to provide support for Clintons claims We sifted through the projects aggregated news reports about confirmed and suspected US drone strikes in Pakistan  Yemen and Somalia  where the US primarily sends drones to target members of al Qaida and its affiliates We searched for reported deaths of terrorists and militants described as senior  leader or commander through the end of 2009 Under these reasonably restrictive conditions  we found roughly three dozen top terrorists killed Looking just at articles compiled by the  Washington Post   we come up with at least two dozen This number is nowhere near definitive  since it includes several deaths that are disputed On the other hand  the number could be higher since it doesnt include information from unreported strikes or strikes in Afghanistan  Libya  Iraq or Philippines Despite these caveats  a conservative analysis of the evidence does suggest a factual basis for Clintons claim A final note  Clinton also appears to be right about bin Laden being concerned about drones A trove of letters found at Osama bin Ladens compound after his 2011 death reveal that he was concerned about Americas drone use  In an October 2010 letter  he revealed that he was particularly worried about attacks in Waziristan  a region of Afghanistan I am leaning toward getting most of the brothers out of the area  he wrote We could leave the cars because they are targeting cars now  but if we leave them  they will start focusing on houses and that would increase casualties among women and children It is possible that they have photographed targeted homes The brothers who can keep a low profile and take the necessary precautions should stay  but move to new houses on a cloudy day,1,0,721,real

Its manager of general construction? Or its regional operations director for Texas? All men  too Although the company has several women in very responsible roles  the ownership is made up of the Munilla brothers and their families  said Donald Silver  a spokesman for MCM It is so unfortunate that some junk news sites chose to carry unsubstantiated stories that were false and hurtful To bolster the flimsy case against women construction workers  the Squawker article places great weight on an interview between an MCM employee and her alma mater  Florida International University Leonor Flores  a project executive at MCM and a 1998 graduation of FIU  was interviewed for an article that would appear on FIUs website about the FIU Sweetwater UniversityCity Bridge Its very important for me as a woman and an engineer to be able to promote that to my daughter  because I think women have a different perspective Were able to put in an artistic touch and were able to build  too  Flores told FIU in an article that ran March 3  less than two weeks before the March 15 bridge collapse The Squawker article pointed to Flores quote as proof that MCM had allowed senior ranking female employees to prioritize aesthetics over safety The Squawker article characterizes Flores quote as follows  Leonor Flores  FIU alumna  and MCM project exec says her number one priority when building bridges is to make sure they look pretty Nothing else matters But lets set to one side this rather extreme reading of Flores quote An update to the FIU article issued a day after the bridge collapse clarified that Leonor Flores did not work on the FIU Sweetwater UniversityCity Bridge project in any capacity Silver  the MCM spokesman  confirmed Flores was not the project manager on the FIU pedestrian bridge construction project,3,0,493,fake

We wondered if Trump really has said hed put allowing guns in classrooms at the top of his priorities list Throughout the election  he has advocated for getting rid of gun free zones at schools and military bases  arguing that this could prevent mass shootings in these types of locations And he did say once during the primary that he would get rid of these zones on his first day in office I will get rid of gun free zones in schools  and   you have to   and on military bases  he said at a Jan 7 rally in Vermont  On my first day  it gets signed  okay  my first day Theres no more gun free zones The Outdoor Channel asked Trump about this plan in an interview two weeks later Im going to get rid of gun free zones on military bases and Im also going to do it in schools  he said  adding that he would try to work with the states or perhaps override the states if I have to The topic came up again in May  when Trump accepted the NRAs endorsement In the days that followed  he waffled on whether he wants schools to allow guns on campus In his May 20 speech accepting the endorsement  he said  Were getting rid of gun free zones  okay I can tell you that Were getting rid of them On May 21  Trump tweeted   Crooked Hillary said that I want guns brought into the school classroom Wrong! He then made a seemingly contradictory claim on Fox News the next day  May 22  He doesnt advocate for guns in the classroom  but sometimes teachers should have guns in the classroom I dont want to have guns in classrooms  he said Although  in some cases  teachers should have guns in classrooms  frankly Because teachers are  you know Things that are going on in our schools are unbelievable You look at some of our schools  unbelievable whats going on But Im not advocating guns in classrooms But remember  in some cases  and a lot of people have made this case  teachers should be able to have guns Trained teachers should be able to have guns in classrooms We looked through other transcripts and interviews Trump has given since May  but we were unable to find further clarification about his position His campaign did not respond to our request for comment One final note  Its highly unlikely Trump could let people carry guns onto school property on his first day in office Regulations against possessing or firing a gun in a school zone is written into federal law and would take congressional approval to overturn Meanwhile  states have their own laws prohibiting guns in schools that would need to be repealed  as well,1,1,564,real

Yes Even though Southwest Asia supplies heroin to most of the rest of the world  nearly all of the heroin available in the United States comes from Mexico and South America Mexico  and to a lesser extent  Colombia  dominate the US heroin market  because of their proximity  established transportation and distribution infrastructure  and ability to satisfy US heroin demand  the US Drug Enforcement Administration wrote in its National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015  Mexico continues as the primary supplier of heroin to the United States  the White Houses page on the international heroin market reads Estimated cultivation of opium poppy reached 10 500 hectares in 2012  with an estimated pure potential production of 26 metric tons Heres a chart from the DEA report demonstrating the prevalence of heroin from the southern border  As you can see  South America and Mexico have been the sources for much of the heroin in US markets for the past two decades In recent years  Mexican traffickers have expanded by simultaneously wedging black tar heroin into Northeastern markets dominated by Colombian white powder heroin and increasing production and distribution of white powder heroin themselves Mexican heroin accounted for 45 percent of the total weight of heroin the DEA seized and analyzed in 2012  South American heroin accounted for 51 percent  By 2014  the proportion of Mexican heroin had grown to 79 percent  South American heroin made up about 17 percent   DEA spokesman Russell Baer told PolitiFact in September This market share is also reflected in the amount of heroin seized at the border and the amount grown in Mexico From 2013 to 2015  the amount of poppy fields cultivated in Mexico increased by 169 percent from 11 000 hectares to 28 000 hectares  according to Baer In 2008  the total amount of heroin seized at the US Mexico border  about 560 kilograms  surpassed the amount seized from commercial airlines for the first time  about 400 kilograms  Border seizures nearly quadrupled from 2008 to 2015  2 210 kilograms   according to data provided to us by Baer The majority of the drugs in the US market are trafficked across the Southwest Border from Mexico into the US Southwest Border seizures conducted by US Customs and Border Protection  while not the complete picture  provide insight into trafficking trends  he said Traffickers typically smuggle the drugs in through secret compartments in vehicles across the border  illegally and legally   transport them to stash houses in hub cities like Dallas  Los Angeles and Phoenix  and then distribute to the Midwest and East Coast,1,0,517,real

We looked at the polls cited in the story as well as additional polls to provide a more complete picture We found that The Gateway Pundit cited the early June polls that were the most favorable to Trump  a Fox News poll showed that 45 percent of respondents approved of Trump while Rasmussen Reports showed 47 percent approval for Trump A compilation of polls by Real Clear Politics in early June showed that five other polls  including Gallup  all had slightly less favorable results for Trump For Obama  The Gateway Pundit cited a Rasmussen poll that showed Obamas approval was at 46 percent on June 9  2010 Some experts have raised questions about Rasmussens polls  because they are based on likely voters  which is a smaller sample than most other polls  historically  Rasmussen has tended to report more favorable results for Republicans generally and Trump in particular So we looked at one other poll from the same time  Gallup   and also found Obama had the same approval rating We also found the comparison between Trump  Obama and Reagan in a story about a poll by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal  The story said that Trumps approval was 44 percent in early June  matching the results for Reagan  in June 1982  and Obama  in June 2010  before both presidents saw their parties lose a significant number of House seats in the midterms Historically  the presidents party usually gets shellacked during the midterms  The Gateway Pundit did not cite this NBC WSJ poll  which has some warning signs for Republicans in general  including that Democrats were far more enthusiastic than Republicans about the upcoming midterms Also  48 percent of voters indicate theyre more likely to support a congressional candidate who promises to provide a check on President Trump  compared with 23 percent who say theyre less likely to support such a candidate Karlyn Bowman  a polling specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute  cautioned against drawing conclusions about what the polls in early June mean for the midterm election in November Although polls have more predictive value as we get closer to Election Day  we are still more than 100 days out  she said Steven Smith  a Washington University political scientist  said that there is considerable variation in presidential job approval ratings across survey organizations These differences are due to variation in sampling frames  question wordings  weighting  and other factors Consequently  claims like the Gateway Pundit claim that depend on differences of a few percentage points using different survey organizations findings are questionable The comparisons simply are not reliable  he said,1,0,542,real

Our research showed that the ad was right on track Ernst called for the closure of both agencies in April Will she do away with the Education Department? Ernst is a state senator who won the Republican nomination for US Senate Shes running against the Democratic nominee  US Rep Bruce Braley Ernst brought up both the Education Department and the EPA in the Republican primary debate on April 24  2014 One of the moderators asked candidates how they would fund repairs for the nations crumbling road and transportation systems Ernst suggested cutting the federal budget to free up funds I do believe that we can make the cuts necessary within our federal government  Ernst said  She called for closing the doors to the Department of Education at the federal level And not just because it would save taxpayer dollars  but because I do believe our children are better educated when its coming from the state We ran those comments by Ernst spokeswoman Gretchen Hamel  who said that Ernst wants to see power taken from Washington and put back in the hands of Iowans She is about state driven policy  Hamel said According to the Education Departments website the federal role in education is limited States handle almost all education policy and issues But  at the federal level   the Education Department takes on many tasks such as conducting research and overseeing state policy to prevent discrimination It also awards and distributes federal financial aid in the form of loans and grants The ad says that if Ernst is elected  213 000 Iowa students would lose their federal Pell Grants According to federal numbers   that is the number of Iowans who received Pell Grants in 2011 12 We asked the Ernst campaign what her plan for Pell Grants is  but we didnt get a response What about the EPA? While answering the same question that prompted her Education Department response  Ernst also mentioned the EPA Lets shut down the EPA  she said Ernst gave the same rationale for this slash in government  saying  The state knows best how to protect resources So  the ad is on solid ground Ernst did say that she would shut down the EPA Agriculture and manufacturing are two of Iowas key industries   and they are both heavily affected by EPA regulation Hamel  Ernsts spokeswoman  said that Joni wants to have Iowa make its own decisions The ad also refers to the Clean Air Act This raises the question of how states would deal with national issues  like air pollution Unlike the Education Department  where the states already play a huge role  this could be more complicated for the EPA Two experts on environmental law told us that abolishing the EPA would dramatically reduce regulations on industry Nearly all states have seen significant cuts in the budgets of their state environmental agencies in recent years   said one of them  Joel A Mintz  a law professor at Nova Southeastern University who specializes in environmental law Although some states may have the expertise  resources and political will to subsume EPAs responsibilities  many   probably most   do not,3,0,649,real

1612,2010-03-23T18:22:24-04:00,2010,democratssenategov,Bart Stupak,There will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation,With the health care bill teetering in the balance  antiabortion Democrat Rep Bart Stupaks announcement hours before the final vote that an agreement had been reached on the abortion issue marked a momentous shift For weeks  Stupak insisted he and a group of other abortion foes in the House could not support the Senate bill because it would result in federal funding of abortions  contrary to longstanding federal policy But on the afternoon of March 21  2010  Stupak said in a news conference that the promise of an executive order on abortion from President Barack Obama convinced him there will be no public funding of abortion in this legislation Stupaks comments several hours later on the House floor provided some of the most emotionally charged moments of the late night health care debate It is the Democrats who  through the presidents executive order  ensure that the sanctity of life is protected  Stupak said His comments were interrupted by catcalls from the bills Republican opponents  one of whom was heard to yell baby killer! Texas Republican Rep Randy Neugebauer later said he was the one who shouted But he said he yelled Its a baby killer  referring not to Stupak  to whom he apologized   but to the agreement Stupak helped forge with the president The abortion issue in the health care reform debate has been thorny from the start From early on  legislators on both sides of the abortion issue professed a desire to maintain the status quo on abortion in the health care bill But that quickly proved difficult  if not impossible Heres why  Since 1976  the federal government has been guided by the Hyde Amendment  a law that prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape  incest or when the mothers life is in peril Due to that amendment    which must be renewed every year    abortion services are not provided in health care plans offered to federal employees and for active and retired military But the health care reform bill proposes a health care exchange in which private insurance companies could compete for the business of people who do not get their insurance through an employer The question then  Should private companies be allowed to offer abortion coverage  as most already do ? And what if the people buying policies are getting government subsidies to buy insurance? In the House  Stupak helped add an amendment that bars anyone who accepts federal subsidies for health coverage from buying a plan with abortion coverage on the exchange The amendment does let them choose a plan with abortion coverage if they pay for it without using federal subsidies And those who accept subsidies can still buy an abortion rider    that is  a separate policy covering abortion    as long as they pay for it entirely with their own money The Senate took a different tack The Senate language on abortion  written by an abortion opponent  Sen Ben Nelson  D Neb  would allow companies in the exchange to offer abortion services  even to people who get federal subsidies But Nelson inserted measures to ensure abortion services would be paid through patient premiums  not federal subsidies In order to accomplish that  the Senate bill requires that anyone who selects a plan that covers abortion must pay  1 a month toward a segregated fund that would pay for abortion services One plan in every state exchange must offer coverage that does not include abortions  so there would be an option for those who morally object to  1 of their premiums going toward abortion services Legislators supporting the bill    along with President Obama    insist that segregation of funds stays true to the Hyde Amendment restriction on federal funds for abortions The Senate bills proposal on abortion is opposed by activists on both sides of the abortion issue Abortion rights groups like NARAL Pro Choice America  the National Organization for Women and Planned Parenthood all put out statements denouncing the requirement that policy owners or their employers write separate checks    one for abortion services and one for everything else NARAL called the provision unacceptable bureaucratic stigmatization  that  could cause insurance carriers to drop abortion coverage  even though more than 85 percent of private plans currently cover this care for women Abortion foes like the National Right to Life Committee and the US Conference of Catholic Bishops also vehemently opposed the Senate bills abortion language  arguing that if you send federal subsidies to a person who then chooses a plan that cover abortions  thats federal funding of abortion They called the plan to segregate money so that abortions are paid only through premiums    not government subsidies    nothing more than a bookkeeping scheme Until March 21  2010  that was Stupaks consistent position In a Fox News interview on March 17  2010  Stupak said of the Senate bill  It is very clear that abortion is  for the first time ever  a funded benefit by the federal government So  what changed on Sunday that prompted Stupak to say there will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation? In the hours leading up to the vote  he and several other antiabortion Democrats in the House agreed to back the health bill after Obama promised to sign an executive order reinforcing the commitment that no federal funds would be used for abortions The Senate bill already spelled out strict payment and accounting requirements to accomplish that  but Obamas executive order went one step further  putting the presidents weight behind specific measures to ensure that funds are properly segregated By our reading  the order mostly restates and reinforces the intent of the Senate bill But it doesnt fundamentally change the fact that people getting government subsidies for health care will be able to buy a policy on the exchange that covers abortions Thats why some abortion foes    not all    believe Stupak essentially traded his vote for a handful of beans It was issued for political effect  said Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee We dont see any value in the order We dont think Rep Stupak can credibly claim one day that the bill is federal funding of abortions  and then the next day  after getting the agreement on the executive order  that it does not Stupaks issue all along was that if federal subsidies went to someone who could then choose a plan that covers abortions  that was federal funding for abortion And that hasnt changed The presidents order spells out safeguards to ensure the funds are segregated But if you thought that was a bookkeeping trick before  theres nothing in the executive order that would change your mind At the climax of the health care debate from the floor  House Republican Leader John Boehner said that even with the executive order from the president  the Senate bill would provide taxpayer funding of abortions for the first time in 30 years We dont agree Its understandable that abortion foes opposed a proposal that gives more people the opportunity to obtain insurance that cover abortions But its another thing to say those abortion services would be paid with federal dollars The Senate bill states very clearly that public funding through tax credits and government subsidies for elective abortion services offered in the exchange is prohibited But more than that  the bill sets up a mechanism to ensure that abortion services offered in the exchange are paid entirely from patient premiums  premiums paid by people who have chosen a private plan that covers abortion The executive order puts the weight of the presidents word behind providing a way to ensure two checks go to insurers every month  so that abortion dollars and federal dollars are not commingled We think thats enough to back up Stupaks claim  There will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation But thats a conclusion we reached before the president promised an executive order  back when Stupak disagreed with us and insisted the bill would have had federal dollars subsidizing abortions We dont understand how the executive order changes Stupaks logic on this issue  but no matter how he arrived as his conclusion  we think hes right now And we rule his claim True,3,1,1364,real

Its unbelievable We knew Uygur was joking about Hatch serving in the Senate for 800 years  Hatch was elected in 1976  not 1210  But we were interested in Uygurs comment that Hatch had once sponsored a health care bill that included an individual mandate We wondered if that were actually the case  so we decided to check it out Our search took us back to the health care debates of the early 1990s  when President Bill Clinton tried to shepherd through a national health care plan with help from First Lady Hillary Clinton The Clinton plan required employers to pay for insurance and then closely regulated both insurers and health care providers through cost controls and purchasing groups To counter that  the late Sen John Chafee  R RI  introduced a plan that avoided the employer mandate and cost controls Chafees plan  one of several Republican alternatives  created a universal tax deduction for health insurance and gave the poor vouchers to buy policies It also required everyone to buy insurance    an individual mandate Chafees plan was backed by a group of Republican senators  including Hatch  according to news reports from the time When the plan was formally introduced as legislation  Hatch was one of the co sponsors Two other current senators also co sponsored the plan  Sen Charles Grassley  R Iowa  and Sen Richard Lugar  R Ind We examined the old legislation  which we found in the THOMAS legislative database The individual mandate in that proposal appears to work the same as the mandate in the new law The main difference is how the fines work for those who dont buy insurance The new law sets a dollar amount  the older proposal set the fee at 120 percent of average premium limits  as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services We contacted Hatchs office to ask for an explanation for Hatchs change of position  but we didnt hear back Last year  Kaiser Health News interviewed former Sen Dave Durenberger  R Minn  who had also co sponsored the plan Durenberger said that it was Republicans who had changed in the years since 1993  backing away from policies on health care they once supported Uygur asked  Did you know that Hatch co sponsored the 1993 bill that had an individual mandate? We didnt  but we checked the record Hatch was the co sponsor of a Republican backed bill that included an individual mandate,4,0,600,real

Pelosi said  The first conversation I had with him after the election  that week of the election  we talked about that subject  and a subject that his family is interested in as well But what he has proposed is something that benefits    70 percent of the benefits go to people making over  100 000 a year We decided to check out Pelosis claim Its important to note she is not referring to the estimated benefits of paid family leave  but the monetary benefits of Trumps child care tax proposals Trump has made no formal attempts to advance his paid family leave policy yet  although both Democratic and Republican senators introduced two different bills on this general issue So all we have is an analysis of his proposal from the campaign Trumps proposal includes six weeks of paid maternity leave if no policy is offered by an employer  tax deductions for child care expenses up to age 13  capped at the average cost of childcare per state  a refundable tax credit for child care costs for lower income families  and expanding tax free savings accounts for childcare and school tuition The Tax Policy Center  run by the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution  released its study of Trumps child care plan Feb 28  a few days before Pelosis interview Pelosis spokesman confirmed she was citing this report on during her CNN interview The Tax Policy Center study found that 70 percent of total tax benefits would go to families earning more than  100 000 The reason? Trumps plan relies on tax deductions  which are worth more per dollar for higher income families Thats because families with higher incomes face higher marginal tax rates Lower income families may spend less on child care because they often rely on informal  low cost arrangements Chye Ching Huang  one of the studys co authors and deputy director of federal tax policy at the left leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities  said in an email  The estimate that 70  percent of the benefits go to those with incomes over  100 000 is conservative    the share going to those with incomes over  100 000 could very well be higher Analysts looked at three new tax benefits related to child care proposed by his campaign  the deduction for child care expenses  a refundable credit aimed at low income families without stay at home parents  and the expansion of tax free savings accounts According to their report  Trumps plan would increase the average after tax income for families by about  190 in 2017 Those with an income below  40 000 per year might see an increase of  20 or less Families making between  100 000  200 000 per year might see an average jump of  360 Further  they say Trumps proposed tax credit for lower income families is worth less than the deduction Taxpayers who claim the credit would benefit by up to 77 cents per dollar spent on child care Those claiming the deduction may receive between 10 and 396 cents per dollar spent on child care Lower income families are also less likely to place money into Trumps proposed savings accounts due to lower levels of financial liquidity In sum  then  the report finds that Trumps current family leave policy is regressive  helping families in higher income brackets more than those in lower income ones Alan Cole  an economist from the Tax Foundation  said that he agreed with the distribution tables from the Tax Policy Centers report The only caveat Id add is that campaign proposals like this one tend to be refined and revamped after people take office  he said I could easily see the next version of the policy having a different distributional impact The White House did not respond to a request for comment,2,0,710,real

15544,2018-06-28T10:46:37-04:00,2018,wwwneonnettlecom,Bloggers,Twitter caught leaking Donald Trumps private messages in undercover sting,An old headline making new waves on social media falsely claimed Twitter was caught leaking President Donald Trumps private messages to the Justice Department as part of an undercover sting operation Twitter caught leaking Donald Trumps private messages in undercover sting  said a Jan 11  2018  headline from Neon Nettle  an online news site created to provide an educational and thought provoking alternative to the mainstream news media  according to its about page Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebooks News Feed   Read more about our partnership with Facebook  One of Twitters senior engineers has admitted to hacking the presidents private data and leaking it to the Department of Justice  the Neon Nettle story said The headline is based on comments made by a Twitter engineer  but the engineer never said he had leaked information to the Justice Department The story cited a video from Project Veritas  an investigative outlet run by conservative activist James OKeefe  who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count in 2010 for using a fake identity to enter a federal building and was sued for  1 million in 2017 Project Veritas has a proven history of using undercover reporting   hidden cameras and selectively edited video recordings to serve a predetermined narrative In 2017  the organization sent a woman posing as a sexual assault victim of Roy Moore   a candidate for US Senate in Alabama   to the Washington Post in an apparent effort to discredit the papers investigation into Moores predatory behavior For this particular sting video  Project Veritas used hidden cameras to surreptitiously record two separate conversations between undercover journalists and Clay Haynes  a senior network security engineer at Twitter  according to LinkedIn The journalists  dressed in disguises  asked leading questions in a clear effort to elicit certain responses from Haynes Were more than happy to help the DOJ with their little investigation  into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election   Haynes  who also expressed his personal disdain for Trump  said at one point Basically  giving them every single tweet that hes posted Even the ones hes deleted  any direct messages  any mentions In the second interview  Haynes said of the possibility of turning over Trumps messages  We have a subpoena process for that very reason When asked whether Twitter was working with the Justice Department  he declined to comment Both interviews occurred in January 2018  and Twitter issued a statement after Project Veritas published its video The individual depicted in this video was speaking in a personal capacity and does not represent or speak for Twitter  a company spokesperson said  Twitter only responds to valid legal requests  and does not share any user information with law enforcement without such a request We deplore the deceptive and underhanded tactics by which this footage was obtained and selectively edited to fit a predetermined narrative  the spokesperson said Twitter is committed to enforcing our rules without bias and empowering every voice on our platform  in accordance with the Twitter Rules It is unclear from the video whether Haynes knew he was being recorded  though he does not seem to be aware It is illegal to record a private conversation without the consent of both parties in California  where the video was taken As Snopes previously noted   Project Veritas videos are virtually impossible to fact check without complete clips of the involved conversations because they use stitched together  out of context remarks with no indication of what occurred or what was discussed just before and after the included portions According to Twitters Help Center   legal processes are required to trigger the release of private messages Non public information about Twitter users will not be released to law enforcement except in response to appropriate legal process such as a subpoena  court order  or other valid legal process  the company policy said Requests for the contents of communications  require a valid search warrant or equivalent from an agency with proper jurisdiction over Twitter Haynes did not say that Twitter leaked private messages from Trump He said only that the company would be more than happy to help the DOJ were such help ever triggered by a legal process We searched Google and Nexis and did not find any reports that Twitter was cooperating in this fashion with special counsel Robert Muellers probe into the 2016 election  although the company did meet with the Senate Intelligence Committee to discuss Russian bot accounts on its site But even if we were to take Project Veritas video at face value  the Neon Nettle headline was misleading The video showed Twitter to be capable of granting access to Trumps private messages   a capability that most technology companies maintain   but the company was not caught leaking them Neon Nettle did not respond to a request for

2139,2010-07-29T11:48:49-04:00,2010,abcnewsgocom,Donna Brazile,Over the last 10 years  incomes for the top 1 percent have grown Meanwhile  the bottom half of the country  theyve seen their wages stagnate,During the July 25  2010 roundtable of ABCs This Week  Democratic strategist Donna Brazile made the case for extending tax cuts for low and middle income families  rather than for the wealthy Everyone is concerned about the deficit  and thats why we have to be careful how we frame this I mean  you and I both know that    Stephen  that over the last 10 years weve seen the top 1 percent  their incomes have grown Meanwhile  the bottom half of the country  the bottom half of all income earners  theyve seen their wages stagnate  she said Income inequality has become a fairly common Democratic talking point  so we decided to weigh in on the claim that while income for the top 1 percent has been increasing  its been largely stagnant for the bottom half of the country Braziles office told us to check out a June 2010 report by Arloc Sherman  a senior researcher for the left learning Center on Budget and and Policy Priorities Sherman uses data from the Congressional Budget Office  the nonpartisan number cruncher for Congress  to graph income for different groups over time The data starts in 1979 and goes through 2007 After tax incomes nearly quadrupled for the top 1 percent of Americans in the last three decades  while barely rising among middle  and lower income households  Sherman writes We tracked down the raw CBO figures to see if our own calculations would match Shermans The numbers  which come from the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  and the Current Population Survey  CPS   show average  inflation adjusted to 2007  after tax income The chart shows how income has changed over time for five different income categories set by the IRS There is additional data on the top 1 percent No matter how you slice it  Brazile is on firm ground Those with incomes in the bottom 20 percent had mean income of  16 100 in 1997 In 2007  it climbed to  17 700    or up 99 percent For the group on the next rung up the ladder  income grew by 159 percent For those ranked between 41 and 60 percent of income   only some of whom are in the bottom 50 percent    income grew from  48 000 in 1997 to  55 300  or about 152 percent Thats not stagnant  but its small potatoes compared to a 746 percent jump in income for the top 1 percent of earners Mean income for that group climbed from  755 700 to slightly more than  13 million between 1997 and 2007 We then moved to income data from the US Census Those inflation adjusted figures start in 1967 and go through 2008 Looking at the 10  years  1998 to 2008  mean reported income for those at the bottom fell by 42 percent  for the next lowest income group it dropped by 39 percent  and for the group that includes some in the lowest half of incomes and some who are not  income decreased by 25 percent During the same period  income for the top 5 percent  the figures do not include information on the top 1 percent   increased by about 05 percent We should note  however  that if we look at income for the top 5 percent between 1998 and 2007  as opposed to 2008 when the economy began spiraling downward   thats a 17 percent increase Finally  we contacted numerous independent economic experts  who  for the most part  said that Braziles argument is accurate The big picture statement is exactly right No gains for bottom half  big gains for top 1 percent  wrote Irwin Garfinkel  professor of contemporary urban problems from Columbia University Edward Wolff  economics professor at New York University  told us that  based on his calculations from the the Federal Reserve Boards Survey of Consumer Finances  income of the bottom half fell by 9 percent over the last 10 years  from 1998 2008  while the income of the top one percent rose by 40 percent A few experts did take issue with Braziles use of the phrase the last 10 years As we pointed out  the most recent data for the CBO ends in 2007 Census figures only go through 2008 If Brazile was truly talking about the last 10 years  ie from 2000 to 2010  as opposed to the last 10 years for which the data is available  one may argue that she engaged in a little bit of extrapolation Robert Gordon  an economist at Northwestern University  told us that more and more of the compensation of the top 1 percent depends on the stock market  which took a plunge during the ongoing recession Still  Emmanuel Saez  an economics professor at the University of California Berkeley  argues in a July 2010 paper that the Great Recession is unlikely to have a very large impact on top income shares and will certainly not undo much of the dramatic increase in top income shares that has taken place since the 1970s Sherman also pointed out that by convention  it is often accepted to talk about the last 10 years as meaning the last 10 years for which the data exist We also note that Brazile mentioned wages in the last part of her statement  which is a narrower term than income Still  based on our review of the context of the conversation  our discussion with experts  and the statement itself   which mentions income twice  it seems clear that she was talking about income in both cases Donna Brazile said that while the incomes for the top 1 percent have climbed  theyve been largely stagnant for the bottom half of the country We consulted data from the Congressional Budget Office  the US Census  and just to be sure  we double checked with independent economics experts The CBO numbers showed relatively small increases in income for those in the bottom half  compared with the 746 percent gain for the top 1 percent Mean income for the top 1 percent rose from  755 700 in 1997 to slightly more than  13 million 10 years later The most recent 10 year data    from Census    shows income falling for those in the bottom 50 percent and increasing for the top 5 percent Most of the experts we talked to said Braziles underlying argument is on solid ground,0,0,1042,real

In 2009  tax receipts accounted for 148 percent of GDP According to the table  tax receipts as a share of GDP were always higher all the way back through 1950  when they accounted for 144 percent of GDP That would be 59 years    not quite 60  but very  very close The recession factors into the tax revenue statistic as well Both the 2008 stimulus package under President George W Bush and the 2009 stimulus under President Barack Obama included tax breaks as a major component Because the statistics show a number so close to 60 years    and because Conrad was speaking during a television interview rather than a prepared speech or written statement    well give him some leeway and rate the statement True,1,0,515,real

Has weed as we once knew it become more potent? The answer is yes THC levels are on the rise  and they have been for quite some time The University of Mississippi Potency Monitoring project analyzed tens of thousands of marijuana samples confiscated by state and federal law enforcement agencies since 1972 The average potency of all seized cannabis has increased from a concentration of 34 percent in 1993 to about 88 percent in 2008 Potency in sinsemilla in particular has jumped from 58 percent to 134 percent during that same time period Back in the late 1970s   the mean potency for marijuana was about 3 percent  Mahmoud ElSohly  director of marijuana research with the monitoring project  told us in an interview for a prior fact check Further  the number of samples confiscated with a THC concentration greater than 9 percent has increased significantly  from 32 percent in 1993 to 215 percent of the 1 635 marijuana samples collected in 2007 But while the average is up due to the availability of marijuana with a higher THC count  the high mark in potency  somewhere around 25 27 percent  remains relatively unchanged in the last couple decades and isnt likely to increase  ElSohly said For the average adult recreational or habitual user  theres uncertainty about what rising THC levels mean Only a handful of studies have looked at how users smoke marijuana with varying THC levels Several of these studies noted that when test subjects were using more highly concentrated marijuana  they often smoked less than they did when consuming product with a lower THC level In that regard  THC would seem to mimic how people consume beverages with different alcohol content  People tend to drink whiskey in shots  wine by the glass and beer by the mug Marijuana may work the same way  said Carl Hart  a psychology professor at Columbia University who studies the effects of psychoactive drugs Roger Roffman  a social work professor at the University of Washington and author of the upcoming book Marijuana Nation  noted that there has been little research on the impact of potency in cannabis at the levels seen today  especially in products like hash oil  meaning we dont know everything about its potential impact,2,0,675,real

To find out  we first counted up the total number of ballots cast from 2000 to 2014 using the Texas Secretary of States online record  The website includes presidential  congressional  and special elections  but skips over a lot of the more local ones We came up with just about 715 million votes cast  but since the database isnt comprehensive  we rounded up to 72 million  though thats probably still an underestimate  Before delving into how many cases of voter fraud there are  heres a quick definition Voter fraud is the intentional corruption of the electoral process by voters This covers knowingly and willingly giving false information to establish voter eligibility  and knowingly and willingly voting illegally or participating in a conspiracy to encourage illegal voting by others  according to Lorraine Minnite  a professor at Rutgers and author of the book The Myth of Voter Fraud Minnite goes on to distinguish between election fraud   which includes fraud perpetrated by other parties involved in elections  such as advocacy groups or election officials   and voter fraud  which is a subset of election fraud committed specifically by voters Bookers press secretary said he was referring only to in person voter fraud  or voter impersonation  which is the type targeted by voter ID laws  and given the full context of Bookers comments  that makes sense Looking at the kind of fraud that voter ID laws aim to prevent excludes certain categories of fraud  such as those involving absentee ballots A spokeswoman for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sent us information on electoral prosecutions Since 2002  there have been a total of 85 election fraud prosecutions resolved Some of these were dismissed  others were classified as a pre trial diversion  which generally means that authorities agreed not to charge the defendant In total  then  there were 51 guilty or no contest pleas and 9 convictions  for a total of 60 cases of election fraud Our next step was to identify how many cases were of in person voter fraud We reached out to experts who have studied these cases in detail Justin Levitt  a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles  said most of the prosecutions would not have been prevented by the voter ID law There were a bunch of prosecutions for unlawfully turning in a ballot that people werent supposed to have possession There are a few instances of marking someone elses ballot without their consent   those are all absentee ballots  There are a few of fake registration  or of voting while ineligible   none of which are stopped by a rule requiring ID at the polls  Levitt said There are vanishingly few instances of voter fraud   incidents flat out  not just prosecutions   that could be stopped by applying a rule requiring ID at the polls Minnite  the Rutgers professor  pointed us to 2012 court testimony from Major Forrest Mitchell  a criminal investigator with the Texas Attorney Generals office  in which Mitchell admitted that only about five of the more than 300 election fraud referrals that had been investigated since 2002 dealt with in person voter impersonation Mitchells testimony indicated that only two of these cases could have been prevented by a voter ID law Three people were prosecuted  though  since one case involved two people So Booker was off by one when he claimed two people had been prosecuted in the ten years before the ID law was implemented Levitt  for his part  found only three credible allegations of fraud in Texas elections since 2000 that could have been prevented by an ID rule Minnite found four cases of this kind from 2000 until 2014 Four cases of fraud for 72 million votes makes the chance of voter fraud 1 in 18 million,1,0,931,real

Well  I wish we were not pausing  Lieberman said  adding  I was really surprised and disappointed when he decided to toss it to Congress He was right He had the legal authority to do it himself I wish he had done it We wondered whether Lieberman was right  Lieberman was traveling and did not respond  United States law The Constitution and the War Powers Resolution  set the terms for military engagement In Article II  Section 2  the Constitution says the president is commander in chief of the armed forces Then  in Article I  Section 8  it assigns the right to declare war to Congress The last time that actually happened was at the beginning of World War II  when Franklin Roosevelt was president Since then  presidents have generally initiated military activities using their constitutionally granted powers as commander in chief without having an official declaration of war in support of their actions In 1973  Congress  frustrated with the Vietnam War  passed the War Powers Resolution  which was enacted over a veto by President Richard Nixon The resolution required that  in the absence of a declaration of war  the president must report to Congress within 48 hours of introducing armed forces into hostilities and must terminate the use of US armed forces within 60 days unless Congress permits otherwise No president has ever conceded that Congress can limit the presidents power as commander in chief Even as Obama announced that he would seek a congressional resolution  he affirmed that I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization Presidents have danced around the War Powers Resolution They will report military engagement to Congress but specifically omit mention of the section of the law  Section 4 a  1   that triggers the 60 day limit Only one president  Gerald Ford  has ever referred to that clause in a report to Congress Presidents Ronald Reagan  George HW Bush  Bill Clinton and George W Bush never did There is debate over the legal weight of the War Powers Resolution and what the Constitution allows Sen Rand Paul  R  Ky  who appeared on CNNs Crossfire on Sept 9  seemed to invoke both against presidential authority Paul speculated on what Obama would do if Congress voted against the use of force in Syria The real question is would he even abide by our verdict  would he abide by the congressional verdict  Paul said Would he obey the Constitution and say Ive been told I dont have authority  therefore  I cant do it? But in a case involving Clinton and Kosovo   the courts have said members of Congress lack the standing to sue to get a president to comply with the War Powers Resolution The Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal  letting the decision stand During the Libyan conflict  Walter Dellinger    former head of the Justice Departments Office of Legal Counsel and acting solicitor general under President Bill Clinton    wrote  that by regulating the principle that the president may introduce troops into hostilities or potential hostilities without prior authorization by the Congress  the War Powers Resolution effectively confirms that the president can act unilaterally Anthony Clark Arend  professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University  said while the Constitution trumps all other laws  many legal scholars have concluded that the War Powers Resolution unconstitutionally restricts the presidents authority Arend said the president has the authority for quick  limited uses of force Other experts weve asked have generally agreed with this line of argument In short  even under the War Powers Resolution  the president can send in forces without approval from Congress An unresolved legal issue is what happens if forces are kept in place for a longer period of time  but at this moment  no one is proposing that military option Lieberman was discussing whether Obama had the legal authority to act without Congress within the framework of US law We should note that theres a separate question of whether the United States as a country would have legal authority to attack Syria  we addressed that question in a separate story  Here  were only considering Obamas legal authority within the context of US law,2,0,765,real

The timeline presented in this way is a bit confusing  but the blogs didnt try to fairly settle the seeming discrepancy Heres what happened Hogg was at the school during the shooting Hogg shot a video on his cellphone while taking cover in a classroom closet Sometime after that  he went home At around 6 pm  Hogg went back to get interviews  according to Vox  The evening after the shooting  Hogg says  he biked up to the school  where the media was still camped out  the article says This time  he put himself in front of the camera  making his first   but not final   plea for an end to mass shootings Regardless of this information  other conservative news websites including InfoWars and RedState jumped the gun and reported that the CBS interview cast doubt on Hoggs whereabouts during the school shooting Sometime after the original stories  both websites issued updates on their stories to say that the CBS video included Hoggs quote without context But not every site did It appears that the problem was that CBS included a very confusing quote without context  wrote conservative Florida writer  Sarah Rumpf  author of the errant RedState story Hogg was on campus during the shooting and returned several hours later to interview people across the street Claims that Hogg was not at school during the shooting are not based in reality,1,0,521,fake

As it turns out  Clinton did not disappoint   at least on that topic While critics have called the book a bit of a snoozer  the chapter on Benghazi is one of the longest in Hard Choices The book explains what happened and how the State Department reacted   and offers a full throated rebuke of Republican criticisms In defending the United States response to the attack  one of the factors Clinton noted was that theres a gap between popular perceptions about the countrys military capabilities and the reality Critics have questioned why the worlds greatest military force could not get to Benghazi in time to defend our people  Clinton said Part of the answer is that  despite having established United States Africa Command in 2008  there just wasnt much US military infrastructure in place in Africa Unlike in Europe and Asia  the US military footprint in Africa is nearly nonexistent Since Libya is located on the Mediterranean Sea  on Africas northern coast  Clintons claim that the US military is nearly nonexistent in Africa is pretty consequential to the debate In 2007  President George W Bush announced that the United States would create a singular African command responsible for military operations throughout the continent Prior to its creation  jurisdiction over Africa was split between combat headquarters in the Pacific  European and Middle East regions The motivation for the change was that Pentagon planners argued that terrorism and extremism spread more easily in countries with weak governments and poor citizens susceptible to ideological messaging In creating what would become known as AFRICOM  the US hoped to improve its own security by partnering with developing countries in Africa to better handle their own security concerns and avoid another Afghanistan Pentagon officials also thought  however  that a large US military presence in these countries could become counterproductive  offering propaganda opportunities for terrorists and breeding anti American sentiments  said Joseph Siegel  the director of research at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies at the National Defense University The goal all along  he said  was to have a light footprint Instead of a large scale operation  small groups would work with African countries in training African troops to handle the unique security issues within their own borders Bases? Garrisons?

A spokesman for Clinton told PolitiFact that AFRICOM is not even based in Africa Its headquarters are in Germany  where about 1 500 of its 2 000 personnel   troops  civilians and contractors   are located Theres very little military infrastructure or advanced weaponry and warships Of the Department of Defenses annual budget of  520 billion  the Africa Command accounted for just  275 million in 2012 An AFRICOM spokesman noted that Europe   geographically one third the size of Africa    has 12 times the number of US troops Even smaller countries like Afghanistan and South Korea have five times the US forces than all of Africa does Its the smallest of the commands in resources and personnel  and to my knowledge it controls very few assets that it would deploy on its own  Siegel said There is one US military base on the continent   Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti  a country in the African Horn Between 2 000 and 4 000 personnel are typically stationed there That includes some troops  but many of those individuals are contractors or military personnel who are there to run base operations  said Larry Hanauer  a senior international policy analyst at RAND Corporation  a think tank We do not have combat aircraft permanently based in Africa  Hanauer said There are transportation aircraft in Camp Lemonnier  but not fighter jets Even if Camp Lemonnier had those resources  Djibouti is some 2 000 miles away from Benghazi Points in Europe are much closer  such as Rome  which is about 800 miles away At the time of the attacks  AFRICOM had to borrow an emergency response force from Europe Command because it did not yet have one According to a New York Times article  the Africa Command did not have a gunship or armed drones Asked whether he thought Clintons statement was accurate  RANDs Hanauer said  I think its more accurate than not Siegel of National Defense University agreed that it was a fair statement So did Michael OHanlon  a director of research for the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution Hillarys right The headquarters is in Germany and our total military force on the continent is a total of a few thousand at most dispersed in various small locations  not operational bases,4,0,828,real

On Nov 27  2009  China announced it will lower emissions 40 to 45 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 That may sound like a lot  but its important to read the fine print here China is talking about lowering carbon intensity Its a measurement of how much energy it takes to produce a given amount of economic output Climate experts say this means emissions from China will likely continue to grow along with its economy  but not as quickly as they would have otherwise Lets say you commit to an intensity target of  6  per year in carbon GDP  wrote climate scientist Jonathan Koomey  professor at Yale Universitys School of Forestry and Environmental Studies If your GDP grows at 10  per year  that means your carbon emissions will still grow 4  per year So youre improving your carbon efficiency but absolute emissions are still increasing Indeed  Chinas GDP is growing rapidly In the third quarter of this year  it grew 89 percent  likely bringing the total annual growth to 8 percent On Dec 4  India offered a similar proposal Officials there say the country is prepared to cut carbon intensity from 20 to 25 percent by 2020 Its a landmark announcement for India  traditionally  the country has argued that it cannot afford to curb greenhouse gas emissions But like China  Indias economy is growing rapidly  and with it its carbon emissions Obama  on the other hand  is arguing for a cut large enough that the United States would see an absolute reduction in emissions  explained Koomey  Obamas plan to trim emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 is part of a cap and trade change bill pending in the House of Representatives A Senate bill would require a 20 percent cut  Koomey  like many climate scientists  say overall cuts    even from developing countries    are necessary to really slow down climate change While the United States proposed cuts are more stringent than those proposed by China or India  theyre less aggressive than the 25 to 50 percent emissions reduction scientists say countries must adopt to hold global average temperature increases to about 2 degrees Celsius So  where does that leave Palins claim?

Given the confusion over the program    and a White House denial about the Guantanamo vaccinations    we decided to look into Hannitys claim It all started on Oct 30  when CNN ran a story quoting Maj Diana R Haynie  a spokeswoman for Joint Task Force Guantanamo Bay  who said the Pentagon would be offering the H1N1 vaccines to people held at the camp Detainees at JTF Guantanamo are considered to be at higher risk and therefore they will be offered the H1N1 vaccination  she told CNN JTF Guantanamo conducts safe  humane  legal and transparent care and custody of detainees As such  we must provide detainees the medical care necessary to maintain their health The Associated Press ran a similar story on Nov 2 The news sparked an onslaught of criticism from lawmakers of both parties They said pregnant women  children and the elderly should have priority access to the limited supply of vaccines over the Guantanamo detainees On Tuesday  Nov 3  White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said in a press briefing that  There is no vaccine in Guantanamo and theres no vaccine on the way to Guantanamo But the same day  a Pentagon spokesman said that a shipment of vaccines would eventually be sent to the prison  although he said the detainees would get the vaccine only after it was given to active duty troops  contractors and others working for the government The most recent news reports say that about 300 vaccines arrived at the installation on Monday  Nov 9 According to the Associated Press  its unlikely those vaccines will be given to prisoners Instead  they are meant for military personnel  contractors and US workers at the base We have an obligation to provide for the health of  the detainees   but were faced with a situation where we have a limited amount of vaccines at this time  Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman told PolitiFact Assuming there are enough supplies  the detainees would eventually be given the vaccine  he said The White House told us that  to date  no prisoners have been vaccinated  but that priority for the vaccine would follow this order  US forces  deployed health care workers  civilian and contractor   civilians  detainees and non US Defense Department contractors So  Hannity is correct Current plans say that the vaccines will eventually be offered to the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay  Cuba,1,0,516,real

While the meme features a picture of the House chamber  the most common polling question refers to Congress generally  rather than the House specifically  so we looked at Congress approval ratings overall We found congressional approval scores from October 2014 from five different pollsters on the poll archive website PollingReportcom     Fox News  Do you approve or disapprove of the job Congress is doing? 13 percent said approve   CBS News  Do you approve or disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job? 14 percent said approve   CNN ORC  Do you approve or disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job? 13 percent said approve   ABC News Washington Post  Do you approve or disapprove of the way the US Congress is doing its job? 20 percent said approve   NBC News Wall Street Journal  In general  do you approve or disapprove of the job that Congress is doing? 12 percent said approve That averages out to 14 percent    slightly higher than 11 percent  but in the same  miserable ballpark Were 964 percent of congressional incumbents re elected? To be consistent with the polling  which covers Congress broadly  well lump together the incumbent winning percentages in both the House and Senate There are a few contests still to be decided  but there are enough settled that we can make a pretty close count In the House  we counted 390 incumbents who ran on Election Day Of those  four havent had their races called as of Nov 10  so well set them aside Of the remaining 386 incumbents  373 won  for a winning percentage of 966 percent If you add in three incumbents who ran but lost in primaries  the incumbent winning percentage drops to 959 percent Meanwhile  in the Senate  23 out of 26 incumbents won  with one more  Alaskas Mark Begich  a Democrat  trailing in a race that has not yet been called  and another  Louisianas Mary Landrieu  also a Democrat  heading into a runoff If you dont include Begich and Landrieu  the combined House Senate incumbent winning percentage is 954 percent If you do include them  it falls slightly to 95 percent All of these percentages are exceedingly close to the memes stated 964 percent  and theyre a moving target due to late called races So we wont quibble,7,0,530,real

Will they have to submit to inspection by a doctor? Somebody will have to inspect to prove that an individual is or is not anatomically correct But as our colleagues at the fact checking website Snopescom recently noted   theres nothing in the bill explicitly calling for a genital inspection before students use the bathroom There are  of course  other possibilities for verification  such as obtaining a doctors note  Snopes said To clarify the matter  Cole introduced a second restroom bill Jan 12 that calls for schools to verify a students biological sex by examining their birth certificate Both his bills would carry a  50 civil fine for each violation by a student Cole issued a written statement Jan 13 accusing critics of mischaracterizing his bill  which he said attempts to provide clear policies on who can and cant use a particular bathroom to shield school divisions from lawsuits He said he introduced the bill at the request of parents in his district Contrary to what has been said about the legislation  it does NOT require genital checks  Cole wrote He said the legislation would be enforced only when there was a complaint about a students choice of bathrooms If needed  gender could be verified by looking up student registration information or a birth certificate  he wrote Cole told us on Jan 15 that he will propose an amendment for his bill that will make it crystal clear it does not allow genital inspections It would be  I think  blatantly unconstitutional for someone to conduct such a search  Cole said,3,0,627,fake

Here are the responses    Climate change is a severe threat that we must start addressing now  55 percent   Climate change is an issue to address in the years ahead  but its not urgent now  11 percent   Climate change may be happening  but its a natural event that humans cant affect  27 percent   Climate change is not really happening  3 percent   Dont know  3 percent This appears to support Murphys claim We should note a few quibbles   The poll was paid for by an environmental group We always believe its worth noting whenever someone cites a poll paid for by a group with a perspective and a stake in the issue However  the fact that two polling firms  one from each party  were included makes the poll somewhat more credible   On a subsequent question in the same poll    When  if ever  will the consequences of climate change personally affect people like you?    the number answering never was 6 percent Thats higher than 3 percent  though both are small percentages in the larger scheme of things   Theres one other poll that asks a similar question and finds different results But they arent exactly comparable The Pew Research Center    an independent polling organization    surveyed a national sample of 1 504 adults age 18 or older between Oct 9 and Oct 13  2013 One of the questions Pew asked was  From what youve read and heard  is there solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades  or not? Among 18  to 29 year olds  73 percent said the earth is warming  and 18 percent said it was not warming    quite a bit higher than the 3 percent from the other poll The two polls use different age ranges  but if respondents up to age 34 were added in  that would likely increase the percentage of global warming deniers further  since an even higher percentage of 30  to 49 year olds said there was no global warming    28 percent Why such divergent responses? One factor could be the precise wording of each poll But a bigger difference is likely the pool of respondents The LCV poll only counted answers from registered voters  who voted in the 2012 general election  while the Pew poll simply asked adults This means the poll results arent comparable in an apples to apples fashion This difference might have posed a problem for Murphy  but he was careful with how he worded his claim He said 3 percent of voters    not 3 percent of Americans So we dont find fault on these grounds Pollsters dont ask about climate change very often  said Karlyn Bowman  a polling analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute Most polls show that most people believe global warming is real The question for policy makers is what kind of priority it should be  and here  many pollsters show it not to be very high,4,0,722,real

Yes Even though Southwest Asia supplies heroin to most of the rest of the world  nearly all of the heroin available in the United States comes from Mexico and South America Mexico  and to a lesser extent  Colombia  dominate the US heroin market  because of their proximity  established transportation and distribution infrastructure  and ability to satisfy US heroin demand  the US Drug Enforcement Administration wrote in its National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015  Mexico continues as the primary supplier of heroin to the United States  the White Houses page on the international heroin market reads Estimated cultivation of opium poppy reached 10 500 hectares in 2012  with an estimated pure potential production of 26 metric tons Heres a chart from the DEA report demonstrating the prevalence of heroin from the southern border  As you can see  South America and Mexico have been the sources for much of the heroin in US markets for the past two decades In recent years  Mexican traffickers have expanded by simultaneously wedging black tar heroin into Northeastern markets dominated by Colombian white powder heroin and increasing production and distribution of white powder heroin themselves Mexican heroin accounted for 45 percent of the total weight of heroin the DEA seized and analyzed in 2012  South American heroin accounted for 51 percent  By 2014  the proportion of Mexican heroin had grown to 79 percent  South American heroin made up about 17 percent   DEA spokesman Russell Baer told PolitiFact This market share is also reflected in the amount of heroin seized at the border and the amount grown in Mexico From 2013 to 2015  the amount of poppy fields cultivated in Mexico increased by 169 percent from 11 000 hectares to 28 000 hectares  according to Baer In 2008  the total amount of heroin seized at the US Mexico border  about 560 kilograms  surpassed the amount seized from commercial airlines for the first time  about 400 kilograms  Border seizures nearly quadrupled from 2008 to 2015  2 210 kilograms   according to data provided to us by Baer The majority of the drugs in the US market are trafficked across the Southwest Border from Mexico into the US Southwest Border seizures conducted by US Customs and Border Protection  while not the complete picture  provide insight into trafficking trends  he said Traffickers typically smuggle the drugs in through secret compartments in vehicles across the border  illegally and legally   transport them to stash houses in hub cities like Dallas  Los Angeles and Phoenix  and then distribute to the Midwest and East Coast Heres a map from the Justice Department that shows how heroin moves through the United States ,1,0,591,real

He did  back in 2006 That year  Moore wrote an op ed for the website WorldNetDailycom Keith Ellison from Minnesota had become the first Muslim to win a seat in the US House of Representatives Moore said Ellisons faith had no place in the government of the United States because the Islamic philosophy  is  directly contrary to the principles of the Constitution The Islamic faith rejects our God and believes that the state must mandate the worship of its own god  Allah  Moore wrote Dec 13  2006  Common sense alone dictates that in the midst of a war with Islamic terrorists we should not place someone in a position of great power who shares their doctrine In 1943  we would never have allowed a member of Congress to take their oath onMein Kampf  or someone in the 1950s to swear allegiance to theCommunist Manifesto Congress has the authority and should act to prohibit Ellison from taking the congressional oath today!

The Clinton campaign referred us to analysis of Trumps tax plan from the Tax Policy Center  which is affiliated with the left leaning Urban Institute According to the report  authored by New York University professor Lily Batchelder  about 20 percent of households and more than half of single parents would wind up paying more in federal taxes How? First  Trumps proposal to increase the standard deduction wouldnt be enough to offset the amount many single parents could have deducted with personal exemptions  which Trump would take away  For example  a single mother with one child can take a  9 350 standard deduction and two  4 050 exemptions  one for herself and one for her child in 2017 under the current system   or  17 450 in exemptions in total Under Trumps plan  she would be able to take just a  15 000 standard deduction The end result? That mother would have to pay income tax on an additional  2 450 under Trumps plan Second  the head of household filing status currently applies to unmarried filers with dependents  and their standard deduction and tax rates are between those of married filers and single filers Repealing this provision as Trump proposes would require single parents to file as individuals with higher tax rates Third  Trumps three brackets would increase taxes for many head of household filers For example  the current lowest bracket is 10 percent  but Trumps lowest bracket is 12 percent For example  in 2017 a single parent with one child who claims the standard deduction would face a 25 percent tax rate on adjusted gross income between  53 050 and  68 550  compared with just a 15 percent rate under current law  Roberton Williams  an analyst at the Tax Policy Center  wrote in Forbes Put it altogether  51 percent of single parents or about 58 million households would see a tax increase under Trumps plan  Batchelder calculated As our colleagues at FactCheckorg noted   single parents tend to do worse under Trumps plan than under current law For example  a single parent with an income of  75 000 and two school age children would see his or her taxes increase by  2 440 or by  1 640 if the family had child care costs that could be deducted under Trumps plan  according to Batchelder Similarly  a single parent making  50 000 and who had three children would face an increase of  1 188 The Tax Foundation  a free market oriented think tank  has not released similar analysis But its director of federal projects  Kyle Pomerleau  found no faults with Batchelders report The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment,3,0,585,real

Trump took an aggressive position on tax rates for hedge fund managers during his fight for the Republican nomination In an interview with CBS in August  Trump called them paper pushers who did not build this country In a Republican debate in September  Trump said his tax plan would make them pay more The hedge fund guys wont like me as much as they like me right now I know them all  but theyll pay more  Trump said After the Republican debate  Trump released the outline of his tax plan  Trumps plan eliminates the so called carried interest tax loophole  which allows general partners in private investment firms  including most hedge fund managers  to treat some of their income as income from investments  or capital gains  subject to a top tax rate of 238 percent  instead of the much higher tax rate for ordinary income  434 percent  Under Trumps plan  income from carried interest would no longer be treated as capital gains Tax rates for ordinary income tops out at 25 percent under Trumps plan This looks like a hike in line with Trumps promises Except Along with private equity and venture capital funds  many hedge funds are structured as partnerships Under Trumps plan  income through a business partnership is taxed at a rate of no more than 15 percent  significantly less than the 238 percent they previously paid  according to an analysis of Trumps tax plan from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center Eliminating the carried interest loophole actually helps these hedge fund managers under Trumps plan If carried interest was still treated as capital gains  it could be taxed at the top rate for capital gains in the plan  20 percent   higher than the fixed 15 percent tax for partnership income Trumps plan presents the discounted rate for partnership income as a way to help the small businesses that are the true engine of our economy It also helps large businesses and wealthy financiers who structure their businesses as partnerships  including the hedge funds managers he attacked in his campaign Clinton also said that rates for hedge fund managers would be lower than for middle class families under Trumps plan Defining the middle class can be tricky  but in the Pew Research Centers range of  42 000 to  125 000 for a household of three in 2014  a substantial number of middle class households would make enough to qualify for a marginal tax rate of more than 15 percent if Trumps plan were enacted Not all of these people would pay more than 15 percent overall  according to Bob Williams at the Tax Policy Center  and it would be difficult to say how many middle income people would pay more than hedge fund managers once the many different variables involved played out But some would  Williams wrote in an email In May  Politico reported that the Trump campaign had engaged two economists to craft a new tax plan The Trump campaign has not confirmed whether they plan to re write their tax plan  and did not respond to Politicos request for comment The tax plan announced in September remains on Trumps website  and is the basis of this article The Trump campaign did not respond to our request for comment on this article,1,0,684,real

Theyll get stuck with up to a  50 billion tab for the taxpayer dollars Obama is using to pay for his takeover of GM In its bankruptcy filing  the company said it has  17281 billion in debt and  8229 billion in assets   all that despite a  20 billion General Motors has already received from the government  money that was initially earmarked for buying bad mortgages from banks Now  the company will adopt a restructuring plan that is tailored to the realities of todays auto market  said Obama Its a plan that positions GM to move toward profitability  even if it takes longer than expected for our economy to fully recover  and its a plan that builds on GMs recent progress in making better cars So  theres no dispute that the government is invested in General Motors   it has already shelled out  20 billion in loans   but is Steele correct about the governments new financial ties to the ailing company?

Unemployment 96 percent The real unemployment number is 165 for July The federal government is now on track for the second largest budget shortfall in 65 years  91 of GDP And in 31 months  Congress has added  44 trillion to the 10 year spending baseline Whos going to lend us more money? Beck said on his Aug 25  2010  show In this item  well focus on the claim that the federal government is now on track for the second largest budget shortfall in 65 years We turned to the Congressional Budget Office  CBO   the official scorekeeper for Congress Its most recent estimates  published in August 2010  indicate that in 2010  the federal deficit will exceed  13 trillion As a percentage of the US Gross Domestic Product    the value of the goods and services that the economy produces    thats 91 percent  as Beck said How does that compare with previous years? We checked data going back to 1930 from the Office of Management and Budget  OMB   a government agency that helps prepare the presidents annual budget Only in 2009 and in the war years 1942  1943  1944 and 1945 was the deficit to GDP ratio higher than 91 percent  according to the OMB But going back 65 years only takes you to 1946  so that would put 2010 on track to be the second highest  according to CBOs figures The CBO and the OMB have slightly different projections for the 2010 deficit  with the CBOs being the more recent The discrepancy arises from differences in the agencies projections of future economic conditions and the impact of legislation enacted after the OMB completed its estimates OMB projected in July that the 2010 deficit will be 106 percent of GDP That would make it the biggest in 65 years    not the second biggest But looking back 65 years and using the CBOs estimate  as Beck did  the deficit was higher as a percentage of GDP only in 2009  when it stood at 99 percent We thought it would be valuable to explore the reasons behind the current deficit as well as the projected deficits over the next decade We spoke to a number of economists and found that they offer different explanations Brian Riedl  a budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation  told us via e mail that the main drivers of todays deficit are the ongoing economic downturn  which has reduced government revenues  and the policies that the government has enacted in response to the crisis Recession automatically reduces revenues and increases unemployment and antipoverty spending  even if Congress does nothing At the same time  we have enacted  1 trillion in stimulus spending  plus TARP  Fannie Freddie bailouts  and large discretionary spending hikes So enacted policies are certainly a contributor  Riedl wrote The CBO provided a similar explanation This years deficit is attributable in large part to a combination of weak revenues and elevated spending associated with the economic downturn and the policies implemented in response to it Speaking about future projections  Riedl wrote that future deficits are likely to remain well over a trillion due to runaway government spending Kathy Ruffing  a senior policy analyst at the liberal leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities  emphasized that even before President Barack Obama took office  the CBO had already projected that the 2009 deficit would exceed  1 trillion The 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan accounted for over  500 billion of that  she wrote on June 28  2010 Riedl  however  disagrees Both recent and future budget deficits have been blamed largely on the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts  and to a lesser extent on the war on terrorism  but the data contradict these myths In reality  spending is almost exclusively the problem  he wrote in a June 2010 report Finally  Chris Dreibelbis  the outreach and public liaison for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget  a bipartisan Washington  DC  think tank  pointed to the recession and the policy responses to it as the main culprits in the current deficit Going forward  the structural problems that were there before the recession will combine with the growth in spending from an aging population and health care costs  to cause large and ongoing deficits even once the economy recovers  he wrote us in an e mail So lets review Beck said that were on track to have the second biggest budget deficit in 65 years According to the Congressional Budget Office  hes right Going by the administrations own estimate  the situation is even more dire,3,0,835,real

the House Appropriations  panel  announced a plan to ban earmarks to for profit companies than Sen Jim  DeMint  R SC  sent out a blast of one upmanship via Twitter  House  Appropriations Chair David Obeys partial earmark ban wouldnt apply to 90  of  earmarks  DeMint wrote Thats a fig leaf  not real reform While  Congress has steadily moved toward tighter earmark restrictions over the last  several years  the issue has taken on renewed steam in light of the  massive budget deficit and several high profile ethics investigations On Feb  26  the House ethics committee absolved seven members of the defense spending  panel accused of awarding earmarks to companies whose executives and lobbyists  donated to their campaigns Although they were cleared  the ethics committee  said it was evident there was at least a perception among corporate donors that  political donations have an impact on a legislators decision to author an  earmark for that company It was just that kind of conflict that Rep  Obey said he was trying to eliminate when on March 10  2010  he initiated a ban  on budget earmarks to private  for profit companies The move    one of  several earmark reforms Obey instituted for the House    was hailed by several  government watchdog groups as a meaningful step for earmark  reform For profit company earmarks are ground zero for pay to play   said Steve Ellis of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense But what  about DeMints Twitter claim that Obeys partial earmark ban wouldnt apply to  90  of earmarks By Obeys calculation  or more accurately  the research  of his House Appropriation Committee staff  the ban on earmarks to for profit  companies would have eliminated about 1 000 earmarks this year  which came to a  total of about  17 billion Taxpayers for Common Sense  which looked not  only at the roughly 9 000 disclosed earmarks this fiscal year but also pored  through the budget and came up with several hundred more projects it deemed to  be earmarks  put the total number of earmarks at 9 499  totaling  159  billion That puts the number of earmarks not going to for profits  awfully close to DeMints 90 percent Democrats dont really take issue with  that statistic Its what citing that figure implies  as well as the follow up  comment that Obeys ban of earmarks to for profits is a fig leaf  not real  reform The political reality right now is that the public has lost  some confidence in this institution  and one of the reasons is the past abuses  of the earmark process  Obey told the New York Times Earmarks for  profit making companies are the most vulnerable place for abuse in the  system  he said Its a step forward  Ellis said Its not the answer   the be all end all But Im not going to look a gift horse in the mouth Its  real Weve been making progress on earmarks for several years now And Im fine  with that Im not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the  good The day after Obey announced the changes  House Republicans went  one step further  saying their members would renounce all earmarks for the rest  of the year In the Senate  however  banning any earmarks has much less traction Senate  Appropriations panel chair Daniel Inouye  D Hawaii  Obeys Senate counterpart  and a staunch defender of earmarks  called Obeys ban on earmarks to for profits  quizzical Many  if not most  for profit and nonprofit entities lobby  for themselves or employ lobbyists  Inouye told AP That is how most of them  make the Congress aware of their products and services It is no secret that  many of these individuals make political contributions All lobbyists file  disclosure reports These contributions are all fully disclosed and available  for all to see on the Internet Inouye told the New York Times that the  partial ban amounted to Congress ceding its authority to the executive branch   that current earmark restrictions were already working and that it does not  make sense to discriminate against for profit organizations by banning  earmarks to them A difference in earmark policy between the two chambers  would certainly make for some interesting drama when the House and Senate begin  to reconcile spending bills later this year But DeMint  a self described  recovering earmarker  would like to nip this issue in the bud now DeMint  vowed to force a Senate vote on a proposal he introduced earlier this year     along with Sen Claire McCaskill  D Mo  and 15 Republican co sponsors    that  would put a one year moratorium on all earmarks In the run up to the 2008  presidential election  DeMint floated a similar moratorium proposal The bill  was co sponsored by then presidential front runners John McCain as well as  Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama  but it failed by a vote of 71 29 The  Senate will have the opportunity this week to stand with Americans and put a  stop to this wasteful spending  DeMint said Our nation is drowning in debt  that will be paid by our children and well never stop Washingtons spending  addiction unless members of both parties take bold action We need to focus on  balancing the budget  not pork barrel spending that has wasted money on bridges  to nowhere  teapot museums and monuments to politicians Obey told the  New York Times that banning all earmarks would make Congress a rubber stamp  of the executive branch Where I come from  the Congress has a perfect  right  in fact an obligation  to participate in the budget process  but weve  got to try to do it in a way that protects the integrity of the system  he  said This strikes a reasonable balance Ellis  of Taxpayers for  Common Sense  said a one year moratorium is great  but to what end? A  moratorium puts off the issue for a year  he said  but Congress still needs a  long term fix to its spending protocol Some of the projects financed by  earmarks are worthy of federal dollars  Ellis said The problem  he said  is  that earmarks are based more on the political muscle of their sponsors than  project merit We think DeMint is a little too dismissive when he calls  Obeys ban on earmarks to for profits a fig leaf As the recent ethics report  found  private companies certainly believe their contributions win them  earmarks And its naive to think they dont So at the very least  Obeys plan  addresses some of the worst abuses of the earmark process head on But the fact  were checking here is whether eliminating those for profit earmarks would leave  90 percent of earmarks untouched It would There are differences of opinion on  both sides of the aisle about whether thats necessarily a bad thing But  DeMints math is accurate,1,0,1132,real

Not much For starters  Krugmans underlying point    that long term unemployment is a serious problem right now    remains true regardless of which measure you use The average weeks unemployment figure hit a record high in May  while the median weeks unemployed figure hit its fourth highest level ever In fact  prior to the current recession  the average had only surpassed 20 weeks for several months in the early 1980s And the median only broke into double digits during two prior recessions Both of these benchmarks are only half the levels were seeing today Also  the difference between average and median weeks unemployed has been more or less steady over the years    pretty close to the same two to one ratio we see today So todays divergence between the two statistics is nothing unusual by historical standards So  Krugman could have used a similar statistic thats shows a much shorter duration for unemployment But he was careful in his wording  referring to the average unemployed American rather than  say  the typical unemployed American And the two statistics tend to move in tandem  so we dont think that either one is inherently better for describing the situation We think hes on safe ground using the 39,1,0,528,real

Well take a pass on judging that one Giulianis other point is that Romney isnt proposing a national plan similar to what he did in Massachusetts Thats true  too Romney has argued that population demographics vary so much by state that a universal plan cant be applied across the country Instead  he has proposed changing the way federal dollars are made available to states   which is what Massachusetts was able to do   so states are free to draw up plans that suit themselves Add it all up and Giulianis got it right,1,0,270,real

Thats what bloggers claimed in a post that leaves out important context and details about the graphic Fox News accidentally puts up a poll graphic that shows how they are the least trusted network  said boinboingnet in an April 9 post  Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated  as part of the social networks efforts to combat online hoaxes Bloggers focused on a Fox News segment in which Howard Kurtz  host of Media Buzz  talks with Republican strategist and pollster Frank Luntz about President Donald Trump  the media and public trust When host Howard Kurtz asked for a poll to be put up on the screen that asks if the media reports fake news  viewers got a look at the wrong poll   one put out by Monmouth University that asks people which network they trust more  CNN  MSNBC  or Fox News  Boingboingnets post said  Not surprising but a knee slapper nonetheless  the graphic for the poll showed that people trusted CNN most  at 48   followed by MSNBC at 45  Fox came in last place with a mere 30  of those polled thinking that the network was trustworthy Boingboingnet said Kurtz asked then quickly asked for the graphic to be taken down Kurtz did request that the graphic be taken down   but the graphic did not indicate Fox News was the least trusted network In fact  the graphic  based on a Monmouth University poll   asked Who do you trust more? But individuals polled were asked who they trusted more as a source of information  CNN or Trump  MSNBC or Trump  Fox News or Trump   or both equally The Fox News graphic showed that 48 percent of people said they trusted CNN more  compared to 35 percent who trusted Trump more  45 percent said they trusted MSNBC more  compared to 32 percent who trusted Trump more  30 percent trusted Fox News more  compared to 20 percent who trusted Trump more The question was not about the most trustworthy network and was not a direct comparison of CNN  MSNBC  or Fox News The Washington Post on April 9 reported that Fox News pushed back on reports that its network was the least trusted among competitors It said the Associated Press published a story headlined Fox News mistakenly posts graphic showing it lags in trust  APs new headline says Fox News host  Graphic posted at wrong point of show  The newspaper also noted that CNNs Chris Cuomo tweeted a RawStorycom post headlined  Watch Fox host Howard Kurtz panic after graphic shows Fox News is least trusted network RawStorycom added an updated to its story saying it included a response from Kurtz and that the headline had been revised for accuracy Its new headline reads  Take that down  Howard Kurtz surprised after graphic pops up showing Fox News is least trusted network Boingboingnet also added an update at the top of its post on April 12 The amended post said UPDATE 4 12 2018  Yes  Fox did accidentally put up the wrong poll graphic  but Fox has since pointed out that the confusing graphic wasnt actually showing that Fox is the least trusted network Instead  what the graphic intended to do was to compare CNN  MSNBC and Fox News to Trump The graphic asks who people trust more  CNN or Trump  MSNBC or Trump  and Fox News or Trump When looking at it this way  people trust all three networks more than they trust Trump  Kurtz did elaborate on the graphic after his show   not because it was confusing  but because he said the Associated Press ran a story that utterly distorts what happened The AP reported my request to take down the graphic and ended the story there  creating a false impression by not mentioning that I called for the very same graphic shortly afterward  Kurtz wrote in an April 9 Facebook post  This echoed partisan chatter online that I had somehow panicked or didnt want to show the poll graphic  which is flatly contradicted by reality Kurtz wrote that the graphic was mistakenly posted early  while he was discussing fake news  but brought back later in the show   AP ran a correction about that point ,2,0,708,fake

And they pay 300  400  500 percent interest He is right about those interest rates  and some experts think he understates the problem Over the years  a number of groups have looked at the practices of such lenders and found that the rates they charge are enormously high Jean Ann Fox  Director of Consumer Protection for the Consumer Federation of America  an expert on the subject who has testified in Congress  says the bottom line is he is being conservative in his description of how expensive these loans are A November 2006 study by Foxs organization  the CFA  Cashed Out   Consumers Pay Steep Premium  to Bank at Check Cashing Outlets  concluded that check cashers make two week term payday loans based on personal checks held for future deposit at effective annual interest rates between 390 percent  780 percent  The average cost of a  300 loan was 406 percent annual percentage rate  according to this survey The Center for Responsible Lending  a nonpartisan  nonprofit policy group that focuses on fighting abusive lending practices  has a list of the signs of predatory payday lending  The number one sign is lenders who typically charge an interest rate of 400 percent APR or higher Payday loans allow an individual to use a post dated personal check to get a small  short term cash advanThe Congressional Research Service also looked into this lending system and explained how they work  Typically  an individual writes a post dated personal check to the lender  typically for  100  500  The lender holds onto the check until the borrowers next paycheck  The fee on a two week loan  the usual amount of time between pay periods  is between  15   17 per  100 That may seem like a small amount  but it is equal to an annual percentage rate of between 391 percent and 443 percent  according to CRS The Center for Responsible Lending produced yet another study  this one in November 2006  Financial Quicksand   Payday Lending Sinks Borrowers in Debt with  42 billion in Predatory Fees Every Year  The report found that nationwide borrowers were paying more in interest  at annual rates of 400 percent  than the amount of the loan they originally borrowed A 2004 report from the Consumer Federation of America  Unsafe and Unsound   Payday Lenders Hide Behind FDIC Bank Charters to Peddle Usury  put the average loan rates close to 500 percent Edwards is right on the money  says Ellen Schloemer  research director at the Center for Responsible Lending  The rates are outrageous,1,0,465,real

More importantly    five minutes? Really? With tax compliance in the United States estimated to cost upwards of  107 billion in 2005  we knew we had to take a closer look We started by asking aides to Bush    who is preparing to officially announce his candidacy on June 15    for supporting evidence They sent us links to two articles In 2012  the website Business Insider called Estonias tax system scarily efficient  noting that the process takes an average of five minutes The following year  The Economist agreed  reporting that filing an annual tax return online  as 95  of Estonians do   takes about five minutes We decided to go a step further and check with actual Estonians So we contacted four journalists in Estonia who have not only written about economic policy but have filed taxes there themselves Heres the kicker  It turns out Bush was over estimating how long the Estonian system takes   Yes  it is possible to file a tax return in Estonia online in five minutes And probably even in three to four minutes  said Tarmo Vahter  deputy editor of the weekly newspaper Eesti Ekspress    If you have only one  or maybe two or three  income sources  like a salary from your main job  five minutes may be even too long  said Argo Ideon  the political and business editor at the daily newspaper Postimees AS  I have probably used just two minutes several times   It took me no more than five minutes  said Sirje Rank  the foreign editor at the business newspaper  rip ev  Just push the send button Done   Of course  it depends on the person and on the variety of incomes and the complications  but in general  the tax form may be filled even in one minute  said Kaja Koovit  the head of the business desk at the daily newspaper Eesti P evaleht  I can confirm it based on my own experiences Okay  okay  so its an awesome system But what makes it so good? Its because Estonian taxpayers are presented with a tax form that is pre filled with their data All they have to do is add in any additional factors  make sure its correct  and press send We have a simple tax system  a very high level of accessibility to the Internet  easy and secure electronic authentication  highly developed information technology programs and certain tax laws that help us to gather the data from third parties in order to use it for pre filling tax returns  said Mailis Peek da Costa Figueira of the Estonian Tax and Customs Board   Estonias equivalent of the IRS Those third parties that submit financial information electronically to the tax and customs board include employers  banks  pension funds  insurance companies  educational institutions  and non governmental organizations  said Hannes Udde  another specialist with the board Forty percent of taxpayers submitted their return with one click  and it took less than one minute  Udde said If there is additional data required  such as income from abroad  self employment income or property sales  it may take more than five minutes  but it is still very easy and convenient  Udde said Once the taxpayer verifies and submits the data  the tax agency double checks the declared information If no problems come up  refunds are typically issued within five days If a possible error emerges  the agency emails the taxpayer for additional information to reconcile the situation  Udde said Sounds wonderful    maybe its something the United States could benefit from? Well  as it turns out  President Barack Obama proposed something much like this during his 2008 campaign Obama said he would direct the IRS to give taxpayers the option of a pre filled tax form to verify  sign and return to the IRS or online This will eliminate the need for Americans to hire expensive tax preparers and to gather information that the federal government already has on file But a funny thing happened on the way to enactment  Crickets PolitiFact rated it a Promise Broken  Why?

Well  its true by his numbers  Rogers said McCains campaign is correct on both counts Though Obama is a loyal Democrat who has opposed Bush on legislation more often than the average for his party in the Senate  running for president hasnt made him significantly more partisan He opposed Bush 51 percent of the time in 2006 and 60 percent of the time in 2007 In 2007  Obama found himself in Bushs camp on immigration policy  in a series of votes  Obama backed legislation  which failed  that would have provided a temporary guest worker program and new border security measures Obama and Bush also were allied on legislation that raised the minimum wage to  725 per hour over two years and provided  83 billion in small business tax incentives In 2006  as Obama was laying the foundation for his presidential bid  he supported the presidents position on key votes dealing with immigration policy and on making permanent 14 provisions in the Patriot Act antiterrorism law All of which hardly makes Obama a full blown Bush supporter But his record also doesnt put him near the Senates top 10 Bush foes   a list headed in 2007 by Democrats Debbie Stabenow of Michigan  Barbara Boxer of California  Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Patrick J Leahy of Vermont  who each were opposed to Bush more than 65 percent of the time Because Obama has shown a willingness to vote the administrations position on a number of occasions over the past two years  we rule the McCain campaigns claim True,1,0,414,real

From Jan 1 to Sept 26  there have been 3 210 shooting victims  according to the Chicago Tribune The publication says the data it compiles is not the same as what the city offers  so numbers will not match those tracked by the city One shooting incident may have multiple victims  but it still counts officially as only one shooting  the Chicago Tribune site says Even then  data released by the Chicago Police Department also shows there have been 2 521 shooting incidents in the city up to Sept 18 Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel delivered a speech Sept 22 addressing high levels of crime in his city and ways to combat it  outlining a need for more policing  more jobs and crime prevention Gun violence in Chicago is unacceptable  It is pulling us apart at the very moment that our city needs us to come together  Emanuel said  according to the  Tribune  For all the things that make Chicago great  for all the things that make us proud to call ourselves Chicagoans  the violence that is happening corrodes our core It is not the Chicago we know  and it is not the Chicago we love While the number of shooting victims so far this year have surpassed 2015  its important to note that they do not represent homicides  experts told us  However  the Tribunes count of 550 homicides so far in 2016 also outnumbers the 2015 tally of 492 homicides  The wordshooting does not distinguish based on severity of the wound or the type of crime  said Adam Lankford  a criminology professor at the University of Alabama Shooting statistics also include people who shot themselves by mistake A shooting is simply a gun being fired  not someone being shot or killed  said Dewey Cornell  director of the Virginia Youth Violence Project at the University of Virginia The citys numbers are striking  but Cornell said violent crime in Chicago is much lower than it was 20 years ago  mirroring the national trend When you have a flare up in gang warfare in any community  there will be large increases in gun homicides  and Chicago has for more than a century had a gang problem that is much greater than other cities like New York  Cornell said There has been an increase in gun violence in Chicago in recent years  but Chicago does not represent the US and is atypical of other large cities  so it does not make sense to use Chicago as an example to understand crime in the US  Cornell added A plausible explanation for the rise in shootings in Chicago is that gangs have been displaced from their former turf by the demolition of some housing projects  said George A Mocsary  an assistant professor at Southern Illinois University School of Law Violence has ensued as the displaced gang members try to move into new territory claimed by other gangs  Mocsary said,2,0,657,real

Yes It turns out he was In 1973  Trump  as a 27 year old  was president of his fathers realty company  Trump Management It operated nearly 40 apartment buildings  mostly in New York City By all accounts  including his own  Trump was a hands on president and very active in managing the day to day business operations That year  the federal government filed a complaint against Trump  his father Fred Trump  and Trump Management The complaint alleged that the Trumps violated the Fair Housing Act  part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968  by discriminating against tenants and potential tenants based on their race The defendants  through the actions of their agents and employees  have discriminated against persons because of race in the operation of their apartment buildings  the complaint reads Black people  the government found  were often told a Trump Management complex had no availability when apartments were available for rent In one instance  a black man asked about two bedroom apartments at Trumps Westminster complex in Brooklyn on March 18  1972  and a superintendent told him nothing was available On March 19  1972  the black mans wife  who was white  visited the complex and was offered an application for a two bedroom apartment on the spot The government lawyers also interviewed several people who said executives for Trump Management discouraged rental agents from renting to black people In one case  the government said the companys comptroller instructed a rental agent to attach a sheet of paper that said C for colored to every application submitted by a person of color Trump vehemently denied the claims  which he called absolutely ridiculous  according to a 1973 New York Times article  Trump and his company filed a countersuit the following December  claiming the government made baseless charges and asking for  100 million in damages The court dismissed the countersuit Trumps campaign did not respond to our requests for comment But he did offer an explanation in the debate As far as the lawsuit  yes  when I was very young  I went into my fathers company  had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens  and we  along with many  many other companies throughout the country    it was a federal lawsuit    were sued  Trump said We settled the suit with zero    with no admission of guilt It was very easy to do Indeed  both parties settled in 1975 after a protracted legal battle Trump claimed victory  writing in his 1987 memoir   Art of the Deal   In the end  the government couldnt prove its case  and we ended up taking a minor settlement without admitting any guilt However  under the agreement  Trump Management had to train employees about their obligations under the Fair Housing Act and to launch a two year marketing program to inform the community about their fair housing practices  including giving a weekly list of vacancies to the New York Urban League  among other requirements Its also worth noting that most of these suits are typically settled and often quickly    north of 98 percent  Robert Schwemm  law professor at the University of Kentucky and an expert in housing discrimination law  previously told PolitiFact  And in every settlement  the agreement allows the defendant to take voluntary action to remedy the problem without admitting guilt That doesnt mean there wasnt lots of evidence against Trump  Schwemm said,1,0,665,real

We understand There is an alternative measure of debt known as public debt  which does not include money in the Social Security trust fund or other amounts that the government owes itself Using this measure instead  the debt to GDP comparisons are much smaller By the end of 2010  public debt is projected to be 603 percent of GDP  and by the end of 2012  its projected to be 666 percent If current practices arent changed  public debt will reach 90 percent of GDP in 2020  according to the Congressional Budget Office  whose figures were cited by President Barack Obamas national Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform in December Some economists prefer to use public debt rather than gross federal debt  because the public debt will require real money to repay the lenders  which in turn would have a faster ripple effect in the private sector But one measure isnt more right than the other  Marc Goldwein  policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget  a middle of the road budget hawk group  told us last March Boehner may be cherry picking  but I dont think hes misrepresenting in any way Even if the smaller number    public debt    were to approach a total eclipse in a decade  to me  that counts as soon  said Brian Riedl  a research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation Thats because it can take five to 10 years for congressional decisions to turn the budget ship around  he said Well note that these numbers have been growing for decades  roughly tripling since Jimmy Carter left the presidency Under Ronald Reagan  debt as a percentage of GDP grew from 334 percent to 519 percent  and under George HW Bush  it grew from 519 percent to 641 percent It declined under Bill Clinton  from 641 percent to 573 percent  before rising from 573 percent to 692 percent under George W Bush Its expected to soar during Obamas first four years from 692 percent to 1008 percent Well also note that these numbers could change over the course of the next two years  depending on economic conditions and policy choices Still  we considered Boehners statistics valid  and Ryans formulation is equally solid,0,1,664,real

The 2008 primary campaign While the financial crisis came to a head in summer 2008  problems with housing started to bubble up in 2007 during Clintons ill fated presidential primary campaign On the trail  Clinton addressed these nascent issues    particularly the mortgage crisis    as early as March of that year Clinton  still a senator at the time  delivered a speech on the volatility of the subprime mortgage market on March 15  2007  She said too many people were ignoring warning signs The subprime problems are now creating massive issues on Wall Street  Clinton said Its a serious problem affecting our housing market and millions of hard working families She gave specific proposals for addressing subprime mortgages  including expanding the role of the Federal Housing Administration  more borrowing options for underprivileged and first time homebuyers  more safeguards against predatory lending practices and policies intended to prevent foreclosures In August that year  she delivered a similar speech about dealing with problems from subprime mortgages There  she reiterated earlier proposals  and also suggested laws establishing national standards and registration for loan brokers  as well as regulations on lenders I think the subprime market was sort of like the canary in the mine  she said You know  it was telling us loudly and clearly There are problems here  It didnt become law  but Clinton sponsored a bill to implement these policies in September 2007 The first time she mentioned derivatives was in a November 2007 speech in Iowa   A derivative is a financial product that allows investors to hedge against price fluctuations in an underlying asset  We need to start addressing the risks posed by derivatives and other complex financial products  she said You cant let Wall Street send the bill to your street with the bright ideas that just dont work out Derivatives and products like them are posing real risks to families  as Wall Street writes down tens of billions of dollars in investments Companies are taking the loss of a billion here and a billion there simply because the securities they own are worth less than they thought In the same speech  she spoke again of the risky lending that led to the subprime mortgage crisis  adding that she called on then President George W Bush to convene a conference to find a solution And she also pushed for more oversight of financial markets  So as president  I will move to establish the 21st century oversight we need in a 21st century global marketplace I will call for an immediate review of these new investment products and for plans to make them more transparent This November speech angered some of Clintons Wall Street donors  according to the  New York Times  At the tail end of her campaign  in March 2008    still before the financial crisis hit a peak later that summer    Clinton released a six point plan to increase financial regulation  The plan included  in part  more oversight of derivatives and other new financial products  establishment of mortgage standards and strengthened some consumer protections After becoming secretary of state in 2009  Clinton made noticeably fewer comments on domestic policy and financial regulation But the record shows that establishing policies to address the then nascent financial crisis was a key point of her campaign platform in 2007 and 2008,1,0,779,real

Huntsman has said several times that when a president asks him to serve his country  he serves He expanded on the point on Wednesday on MSNBCs Morning Joe  The president is a good man Hes earnest  hes hard working  hes a great family man  Huntsman said But I got to say on the economy  were not near where we should be  and internationally were in places I believe we should not be  spending one out of every six Defense Department dollars on Afghanistan And Im here to tell you that Americas future is not going to be won or lost in the prairies of Afghanistan Its going to be won or lost based upon our ability to compete in the 21st century crowds of Pacific We were interested in fact checking Huntsmans statement  which he repeated in other interviews  that one out of every six Defense Department dollars goes to Afghanistan To do that  we turned to government budget data and an array of defense spending policy experts It turns out there are a number of ways to slice up the defense budget  and you get slightly different numbers depending on which you choose You could consider the current fiscal year  2011  or the one that starts in October  which is 2012 You could also consider authorizations  the legal limits for spending  or appropriations  the money actually approved within the legal limits  We contacted the Huntsman campaign for its source  and it referred us to testimony from Richard Haass  president of the Council on Foreign Relations  an independent think tank Haass testified at a US Senate hearing in May  he opposed continuing the war in Afghanistan  which he said had now evolved into a war of choice Just to be clear  wars of choice are not wrong per se But before undertaking one  it is essential to demonstrate that the likely benefits of using military force will outweigh the costs and produce better results at less cost than other policies Afghanistan does not meet these tests It is not a major terrorist haven  and it should not be assumed it will again become one even if the Taliban make inroads  said Haass in his written testimony  Haass said that if terrorists renewed their activities in Afghanistan  the United States could respond as it has done in countries such as Yemen and Somalia At the macro or global level  Afghanistan is simply absorbing more economic  military  human  diplomatic and political resources of every sort than it warrants The  110 to  120 billion annual price tag    one out of every six to seven dollars this country spends on defense    is unjustifiable given the budget crisis we face and the need for military  especially air and naval  modernization  Haass said We ran the one in six number by several defense spending experts who said Huntsman was either correct or close to it He is correct In the current fiscal year  fiscal year 2011   Congress has appropriated a total of  689 billion for the Department of Defense Of that   1135 billion is for operations in Afghanistan  said Todd Harrison  an expert on the defense budget at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments  via e mail Another expert  Laura Peterson of Taxpayers for Common Sense  said you could choose to exclude money that goes to the Energy Departments nuclear weapons budget as well as money that goes to military construction  and then the Afghanistan spending would be between one sixth and one fifth of Defense Department dollars Huntsman said were spending one out of every six Defense Department dollars on Afghanistan Budget numbers and defense spending experts said thats a reasonable extrapolation  though there are slightly different ways to calculate it as a little more or a little less Still  Huntsmans number is a legitimate calculation,1,0,678,real

On the numerical side  Trump was spot on Every month  the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics releases data from a survey called the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey   or JOLTS One of the key statistics in the survey is job openings nationally In the most recent month for which data is available    April 2017    the survey found 6 044 000 job openings across the country That represents the first time this statistic has ever crossed the 6 million line  going back to the earliest data reported in 2000 Since a measure of the raw number of job openings is affected by overall population growth over time  well also note that the rate of job openings    which is adjusted for the size of the US population    also tied a record in April  reaching a level equaled only in two previous months going back to 2000 So Trump has accurately portrayed the scale of how many jobs are available today in the United States Is this large number of job openings due in part to the skills gap? Trump used cautious wording  Economists agree that a mismatch of skills is clearly a part of the problem  as she put it That said  they cautioned against making the oversimplified argument that the skills gap underlies all 6 million job openings On the one hand  some of the current job vacancies are unquestionably due to the skills gap  said Gary Burtless  an economist with the Brookings Institution If job seeking jobless workers and promotion seeking but under employed workers had exactly the right skills  many of the current job vacancies could be filled faster At the same time  for many job openings  the barrier isnt necessarily the lack of a college degree or specialized training  he said In many cases  the barrier can be overcome with on the job training and experience There are many job openings with more modest skill requirements  Burtless said They require the new hire to learn some extra skills to become more proficient and productive in their new jobs A large percentage of job seekers have the capacity to learn those skills on the job pretty quickly He added that employers who think every job opening can be filled immediately and with a perfectly trained worker are either living in a dream world or living through a Great Depression in which millions of highly trained workers are desperately seeking a job The reality  he said  is that for most current job vacancies  the skill set of todays job seekers is sufficient to fill the great majority of the vacancies Another economist  Aparna Mathur of the American Enterprise Institute  has testified that for many manufacturing jobs  a drag on hiring comes not only from a skills gap but also an image gap Millennials in particular  she said  may have a tainted image of what high tech manufacturing jobs look like today  assuming instead that they are like such jobs decades ago    dirty  grimy  repetitive or dangerous Survey data shows that many workers are no longer interested in manufacturing jobs and there appears to be a stigma attached to manufacturing work  she wrote Few parents want their children to work in this industry  and manufacturing is the last career choice for people between the ages of 19 and 33 In an interview  Mathur said its difficult to tease out how much of a factor the skills gap is in todays job openings She suggested that it may be the biggest factor    but she also cautioned that the image gap is particularly significant for younger workers and added that other issues exist as well  including an unwillingness among some Americans to relocate to areas with jobs And of course  even in an efficiently humming economy  any survey taken at a given point in time will find many jobs that are simply open due to transition  or what economists call churn Many of these job openings will be due to happenstance rather than structural problems with the skills gap,2,0,788,real

Chicagos guns We talked with Bill McCaffrey  a spokesman in Emanuels office He said the city uses the comparison with New York and Los Angeles to demonstrate that Chicagos strict gun control rules wont work by themselves  Opponents of gun control measures argue the city offers evidence that such laws dont work   period  New York and California both have stricter gun control laws than Illinois Guns cross into Chicago not just from Indiana and Wisconsin  but from areas right outside the city Chicago is not an island  McCaffrey said In the first six months of last year  the city   not counting gun buybacks or turn ins   seized 3 912 guns Thats as many as New York and Los Angeles combined  according to the University of Chicago Crime Lab  which got numbers from the cities police departments In Chicago  police picked up illegal weapons at crime scenes and traffic stops  found them with search warrants and investigations  or heard about them when people called 911 to report a man with a gun or shots fired In the same months that Chicago recovered 3 912 guns  Los Angeles got 2 296 and New York 1 385 That wasnt an anomaly  according to Daniel Webster  director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research  who has testified before Congress in favor of strengthening federal measures to reduce gun trafficking For several years under the Clinton administration  an effort to fight youth crime collected gun tracing data for major US cities I can tell you that Chicago consistently recovered more guns than any of the other cities  NYC and LA included  Webster said We pulled those reports from 1998   1999 and 2000  Chicago recovered and traced more guns than either New York or Los Angeles in all three years In 1998  it picked up 16 222 weapons   more than the two larger cities together Why? Webster points out that the city has a lot of gangs  and gangs and guns go together Its police department cracks down on illegal gun possession  making arrests more likely And Illinois gun control laws arent nearly as strong as those in New York and California in deterring gun trafficking into the city  he said Webster told House Democrats in March that studies show state gun laws are undermined by gaps in federal law   people buy guns in states with the weakest laws to sell in states with the toughest laws The same idea works for counties and cities In Chicago  all it takes is a drive outside the city limits  the New York Times reported  such as to Chucks Gun Shop in Riverdale  Ill  the source of more than 1 300 weapons seized in Chicago since 2008 The same store was identified as a key source of crime guns in a  New York Times  piece in 1999,3,0,599,real

Write in votes for Harambe would be treated like provisional or absentee ballots  meaning they wouldnt be counted until after all the other votes  which takes weeks Were still counting votes in California  for instance  Seeing as these Harambe stories popped up immediately after the election  theres no way they were based on real data Plus  every state decides on their own requirements for write in candidates  so not all votes for Harambe would count depending on the state More than 30 states require a write in candidate to file paperwork in order to be an official candidate and at least eight states dont even allow write in candidates The remaining states have no filing requirements How many of these write in votes actually get counted?

We decided to check it out  We previously looked into a Clinton claim about taxes among the working class and the ultra wealthy  Kindergarten teachers The best data we could find on kindergarten teachers comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics  Other statistical sources  such as the National Center for Education Statistics   dont separate out kindergarten teachers specifically According to a 2014 BLS report  there are about 158 000 kindergarten teachers in the United States The figure includes teachers from both public and private schools  though it excludes special education instructors The average annual pay for a kindergarten teacher is  53 480    ranging from less than  34 000 to more than  78 000 This is higher than what the average preschool teacher makes  but slightly lower than that of elementary   middle and high school teachers So the aggregate pay for kindergarten teachers is about  85 billion For some historical context  Susan Moore Johnson  an education professor at Harvard University  said kindergarten teachers have traditionally been paid less than teachers at higher grade levels But the implementation of district wide pay scales has made pay mostly uniform across all grades within a district    with exact salary varying based on experience and education  rather than the grade level However  this is not the case in all districts Johnson added that  according to the National Center for Education Statistics   private school elementary teachers get paid  on average  several thousand dollars less than their public school counterparts So how does the  85 billion collective salary of Americas kindergarten teachers compare to the top 25 hedge fund managers take home pay? This number is a little bit more elusive Hedge fund managers In its 2015 ranking of the top earning hedge fund managers  Institutional Investors Alpha magazine said the group of 25 collectively earned  1162 billion in compensation At the top of the list is Citadel founder and CEO Kenneth Griffin  who earned an estimated  13 billion off his fund Lest your jaw remain fully hinged  2014 was a bad year The magazine called the total  1162 billion bounty paltry compared to what it was in 2013  when the top 25 hedge managers made about twice as much     2115 billion There are  however  some issues with measuring hedge manager salaries  though the experts we polled couldnt name a source that would necessarily be more accurate than Alpha magazines list The magazines report is just an estimate    based on the managers capital gains in the fund  as well as his  the top 25 are all men  estimated share in the firms management and performance fees charged to clients These numbers are hard to verify because no one really knows for certain a managers stake in his or her firm  said Nicole Boyson   a finance professor at Northeastern University Additionally  funds charged to clients vary drastically among and within the different firms  and one would also have to account for how much of these fees go toward running the business  rather than the salary  Boyson said If you could get comfortable with theright number for a hedge fund manager  which I am not sure is possible  then you could compare it directly to the gross pay of teachers  with the caveat that these two groups are likely subject to different tax rates  etc  Boyson said In any case  the best information we have shows 25 hedge managers making about  3 billion more than the countrys 158 000 kindergarten teachers combined    and thats in a bad year for the hedge managers The data here isnt perfect  but the gap between the two professions is so wide that it seems a safe bet that hedge fund managers make more,2,0,702,real

The biggest category decline under Romney was aggravated assault  which declined from 22 018 to 18 800  a drop of 146 percent Given these numbers  Giuliani is right when he says murders and robberies went up  but wrong when he says violent crime went up,1,0,290,real

to children causes autism  according to a misleading viral story on Facebook Now its official  FDA announced that vaccines are causing autism  stated a headline on truthcommandcom  The story stated  For years  fears over vaccines and the onset of autism have been dispelled by medical professionals  but this has all changed Parents over the years have been criticized for abstaining from getting their child vaccinated over autism fears  but now it turns out they were right all along  Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated  as part of the social networks efforts to combat fake news We found that the website misled readers about information related to the potential adverse side effects of the DTaP vaccine Tripedia manufactured in the past by Sanofi Pasteur DTaP   a vaccine given to children in multiple doses  stands for Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   getting those diseases is much riskier than getting the vaccine Mild problems such as a fever or swelling are common  while severe problems such as a serious allergic reaction are so rare it is hard to tell if they are caused by the vaccine The internet has been fueled with misinformation for years about a vaccine autism link A 1998 article in a British medical journal  the Lancet  claimed to show a link between the MMR  measles  mumps  rubella  vaccine and autism but in 2010  the Lancet retracted the study Scientists have repeatedly debunked the myth that vaccines cause autism through peer reviewed studies And yet  the spread of misinformation continues    including by Donald Trump before and during his race for president Vaccine pamphlet on adverse side effects Truthcommandcom stated that the US Food and Drug Administration admitted that autism is a potential side effect in an online pamphlet about Tripedia  Adverse events reported during post approval use of Tripedia vaccine include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura  SIDS  anaphylactic reaction  cellulitis  autism  convulsion grand mal convulsion  encephalopathy  hypotonia  neuropathy  somnolence and apnea Events were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting But that section also includes a disclaimer about adverse events  Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size  it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine Through the federal governments Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System  VAERS    anyone can file a report  doctors  patients  family members    and they dont need proof that the event was caused by the vaccine Government researchers examine the reports and turn over anything suspicious to outside groups  such as the Institute of Medicine for more research Marie McCormick  an expert on child health at the Harvard School of Public Health  told PolitiFact that the reporting system can be gamed When the measles thimerosal autism controversy first emerged  activists encouraged parents to report adverse events regardless of the duration of time since the vaccination and prior events such as previous indications of developmental problems What happened to the pamphlet on FDAs website Truthcommandcom suggested that the FDA had tried to hide the autism link by deleting this pamphlet from the FDAs website But the FDA told PolitiFact that the pamphlet written by Sanofi Pasteur in 2005 wasnt actually deleted    the FDA archived it and sent PolitiFact a link to the pamphlet  Its no surprise that the pamphlet was archived on the FDAs website because the vaccine hasnt been available for many years Cristine K Schroeder  a spokeswoman for Sanofi Pasteur  told PolitiFact that the companys last shipment of Tripedia occurred in 2012 Tripedia is not in use today  she said The companys pamphlets for current vaccines for DTaP  Daptacel  Pentacel and Quadracel  do not list autism as a potential adverse event They do show data from clinical trials about side effects such as the percentage of children who got a fever  or became drowsy Tripedia was originally licensed by the FDA in the early 1990s  FDA spokeswoman Megan McSeveney told PolitiFact The drug maker had to follow what was at the time broad label requirements for adverse events More recent federal regulations about drug labeling approved in 2006 are now more narrow and state that the only adverse events that have to be reported are those for which there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the adverse event The scientific evidence does not support a link between any vaccine  including Tripedia  DTaP   and autism or other developmental disorders  McSeveney said The truthcommandcom website states that it aims to raise awareness to issues ignored by the media We contacted the email address listed on the website and did not get a reply Part way through our reporting the story was no longer accessible on the website The misleading story has circulated at least since March 2016 when Snopes debunked it

14114,2017-05-15T11:46:29-04:00,2017,wwweconomistcom,Donald Trump,The federal tax code includes deductions for birds flying across America,There were a number of head scratching exchanges in President Donald Trumps interview with The Economist posted on May 11   including Trumps claim    easily debunked    that he had coined the phrase prime the pump But one line that raised our eyebrows was about tax deductions for birds I get more deductions  Trump said I mean I can tell you this  I get more deductions They have deductions for birds flying across America They have deductions for everything At first  we were mystified at what Trump was talking about But as it turns out  hes on target    and as a golf course owner  he has reason to know about this obscure part of the federal tax code Well walk you through it The tax deductions in question involve what are known as conservation easements A conservation easement for a parcel of land is an agreement by which the landowner pledges to forgo future development This way  the land remains in its natural state and  among other things  can provide habitat for animals  including migratory birds In typical easements  the landowner continues to own the land itself  but the right to develop it is donated to a nonprofit organization that promises not to build on it The difference between the pre donation value of the land and the post donation value of the land can be deducted on the landowners tax returns as a gift  said Steven Barshov  a land use and environmental law attorney at the firm Sive  Paget   Riesel  PC The exact loss in land value is determined by an appraiser For large or expensive parcels of land  the tax break can be substantial    it can eliminate up to half of the taxpayers adjusted gross income  or all of it  if they are a farmer or a rancher  And if the amount of the gift is greater than one years adjusted gross income  the balance can be carried over through up to 15 future tax years until the value of the donation is exhausted Compared to popular tax deductions like those for the interest on home mortgages  deductions for conservation easements are relatively small Still  they add up  Bloomberg reported that in 2010  almost 3 000 taxpayers used conservation easements to deduct  766 million from their tax returns  according to IRS data  As recently as 2007  that amount was as high as  22 billion Where they have come in for criticism is for disproportionately benefiting the ultra rich Indeed  for a time  the administration of President Barack Obama tried to get rid of the tax break Theyre overwhelmingly for high end individuals and provide little to no benefit to the public  Dean Zerbe  who examined easement donations as a Republican aide on the Senate Finance Committee  told Bloomberg  I dont know if I could design a tax break thats more targeted toward the millionaire set This may explain why this particular tax deduction popped into Trumps head during the Economist interview Forbes noted that when Trump gave the Associated Press a 94 page list of  102 million in charitable donations he had made since 2010  one of the entries was  63825 million for various conservation easements The White House did not respond to a request for information about easements  but according to Forbes  Trump has donated easements for land on the Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles and the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster  NJ Beyond the golf course easements  Trump has also donated easements for his personal estate in Westchester County  NY  as well as his Mar a Lago property in Palm Beach  Forbes reported Easements for golf courses have been particularly controversial  but they have been upheld in the courts  albeit with some restrictions In one case  the US Tax Court denied a deduction for an easement because the golf course used chemicals that rendered the land unsuitable for wildlife habitat But in a 2009 case  the Kiva Dunes golf course in Alabama won its case to claim the deduction after demonstrating that it was used by 46 species of neotropical birds that migrate across the Gulf of Mexico The courts only quibble was the valuation  the donations value was reduced from  306 million to  287 million Protection of significant wildlife habitat is a conservation purpose qualifying a conservation easement for a charitable deduction  David Wooldridge  the Alabama attorney who represented the golf course  told PolitiFact Theres at least one other provision of the tax code where migratory bird habitat could qualify a landowner for tax deductions In general  farm landowners and tenants can deduct expenses related to soil or water conservation  farmland erosion prevention  or endangered species recovery from their federal taxes  where otherwise these would be considered capital expenses  according to a guide for land conservation published by Texas A M University To qualify for this deduction requires a nearby endangered species and a conservation plan approved by the US Fish and Wildlife Service For the record  neither tax benefit applies only or specifically to birds,0,0,832,real

2166,2010-08-02T16:13:52-04:00,2010,abcnewsgocom,George Will,During the recession  the consumer in his native perversity has begun to save The savings rate is now 62 percent,During the Aug 1  2010  roundtable on ABCs This Week  host Christiane Amanpour asked panelists about the current levels of slow growth in the United States economy Growth is happening  Amanpour said  but at 24 percent  which is slower than most people wanted I see you shaking your head in this debate The Financial Times is basically saying that the deficit talk is a phony  rhetorical war and that actually stimulus has had some effect She turned to George Will  the conservative columnist  who had been shaking his head Well  the recovery is now more than a year old  and we know two things about it  Will said Its unusually weak for a recovery after a severe downturn  and  B  starting weak  its getting weaker  for two reasons First of all  the stimulus is running out  Cash for Clunkers has come and gone The homebuyers tax credit for purchasing new    particularly new homes  come and gone Second  the growth so far has been largely driven by inventories  businesses rebuilding their inventories in anticipation of the consumer    70 percent of business activity in a normal time    coming back to the malls The trouble is  the consumer in his native perversity has begun to save The savings rate is now 62 percent So what you have is what I think Keynes called the paradox of thrift  Its a virtue until it isnt a virtue We thought it would be worthwhile to check whether the savings rate has in fact risen to 62 percent during the recession Checking the number itself was easy We looked to the US Department of Commerces Bureau of Economic Analysis  which tracks the personal saving rate  which it defines as the percentage of personal disposable income that is saved The data shows that during the second quarter of 2010  the personal saving rate was about 62 percent  just as Will had said Will is also right to suggest that the rate has risen The current rate is the second highest it has been in any quarter since at least 2004  which is the earliest data BEA offers on the chart we found Prior to the start of the recession in 2008  the saving rate was typically below 4 percent  and much of the time it was below 2 percent In other words  consumers today are hoarding significantly more of their income than they were during the go go days of high real estate values  easy credit and a steadily growing economy So Will is right on the facts But we were also intrigued about whether the higher savings rate has hampered the nations economic recovery  as he suggests Lets begin by explaining the paradox of thrift that Will cited The major tenet is that when people save a lot of money  rather than spend it  they help their own bottom lines    but that if everyone follows that approach  then everybody loses According to the theory  the money saved doesnt get injected into the economy  where it would boost production and profits and help create jobs In other words  a higher personal savings rate  like the one Will is talking about  can actually hurt the economy even as it helps individuals live within their means and hedge against personal economic setbacks We checked with a cross section of economists to see whether they thought this theory    which was popularized by  left of center economist John Maynard Keynes    is generally considered accurate today The experts we talked to said that it has broad  but not universal  approval Most of the skepticism about the paradox of thrift has come from the right Conservative economist Dan Mitchell of the libertarian Cato Institute said that free market economics doesnt dispute that higher saving leads to lower consumption  but it places less importance on that shift Free marketers say that as long as the national income is growing  then the displacement of consumption by savings doesnt matter that much JD Foster  a senior fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation  said that when Keynes popularized the concept in the early 20th century  the money that was saved was actually stuck in the proverbial mattress  at which point it really did leave the economic system By contrast  there are many relatively safe options for parking ones money today  even accounting for the shakiness in the financial sector since 2008 And if a higher savings rate means that people are putting their money into banks or other safe investments  that money makes its way back into the economy as capital available to lend In turn  greater availability of loans can help juice the economy That said  there are still many defenders of the original Keynesian view of the paradox of thrift They cite real world evidence from the past few years  in which investment has fallen compared to pre recession levels despite historically low interest rates Businesses and households evidently do not want to invest as much in 2010 as they did in 2007 because theyre not confident those investments will pay off  said Gary Burtless  a senior fellow at the centrist to liberal Brookings Institution Of course  one reason for their lack of confidence is the very slow growth in household consumption  which is a byproduct of the rise in household saving rates On the surface  then  the facts tend to support the broad version of the paradox of thrift The jump in the household saving rate has thus been harmful to economic growth  at least in the short run Well acknowledge that theres a difference of opinion in how economists view the impact of the saving rates growth during the recession But on Wills core factual assertion    that the savings rate has climbed during the recession    hes correct,0,0,953,real

Trump responded Hes making mincemeat out of our president Then Trump turned to his reliable measure of a persons success  the polls Hes got an 80 percent approval rating done by pollsters from  I understand  this country Okay? Trump said  So its not even done by his pollsters Hes very popular within Russia  that may change An 80 percent approval rating is pretty darn high For comparison  President Barack Obamas job approval rating is currently about 46 percent and peaked at 64 percent in February 2009  his second month in office  according to Pew Research Center  So we wondered if Trump is correct that American polling shows Putin has such a high rating among the Russian people In a first for Trump on the Truth O Meter thus far  he is By the numbers A November study written by four American researchers backs up Trumps point   finding about 80 percent of Russians really support Putin What Trump said is consistent with what we found  said Scott Gehlbach   a co author of the study and a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin Madison Given that Putin achieved strikingly high public approval ratings  the study asked whether Putins popularity is real or if respondents have been lying to pollsters A primary concern for the researchers was the possibility of social desirability bias  the idea that a person who does not support Putin might tell a pollster that they do support him out of fear of retaliation or going against social norms To correct for this  the researchers used a list experiment  a technique used to broach sensitive issues because it does not require respondents to say explicitly that they do or do not support Putin Pollsters gave Russian respondents a list of several Russian leaders and asked how many they support  but not which ones By comparing the difference between a control group  which was presented with a list that did not include Putin  with a group that received a list that did include Putin  the researchers were able to estimate overall support for the Russian president After conducting four list experiments in January and March of this year  Gehlbach and his co authors concluded that the high level of support for Putin is real If anything  their finding of 80 percent support might be an underestimate Gehlbach noted  though  that the study did not account for how many of the 80 percent are devout supporters versus those whose support is fleeting Further  its likely that the Kremlin manipulates public opinion of Putin through tight control of the media Its reasonable that some people support Putin because of what they see on the evening news  Gehlbach said This study is evidence that Putin is genuinely popular in Russia  wrote Joshua Tucker  a political science professor at New York University  in a Nov 24 post on the Washington Posts Monkey Cage blog In sum  the findings suggest both that the West will likely be dealing with a popular leader when it interacts with Putin in the days to come  Tucker wrote One potential wrinkle in Trumps claim is that while the American researchers designed the study  a Russian polling company  the Levada Center  actually conducted the survey But Gehlbach said that doesnt dilute Trumps claim because the Levada Center is well regarded as independent from the Russian government Karlyn Bowman  a public opinion expert and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute  also said the Levada Center is held in high regard and its findings are consistent with related research by the US based Pew Research Center This past summer  Pew found 88 percent of Russians have confidence in  Putin   to do the right thing regarding world affairs Putins standing is substantially lower among Americans  with just 21 percent saying they have confidence in him Gehlbachs article  which will be published in the journal Post Soviet Affairs  also mentions how Putins high approval ratings are often confirmed by Western researchers polls The study cites an Associated Press NORC at the University of Chicago poll that found Putins approval rating to be about 81 percent in 2014,2,0,758,real
8071,2013-07-25T17:09:52-04:00,2013,wwwwhitehousegov,Barack Obama,Says our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years,President Barack Obama aimed to refocus the national debate and put the economy front and center with a speech at Knox College in Illinois It was the same place he spoke as a senator in 2005 about the need for the government to help the middle class He stuck to that theme in this speech  but now as president  he summarized the improvements that have come on his watch He talked about millions of new jobs  burgeoning energy production  and the nations improving balance sheet Our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years  Obama told the crowd In light of Obamas ongoing battle with Republicans over taxes and spending  we thought this would be an interesting claim to examine In this factcheck  we look at whether we are really seeing one of the most rapid declines in the deficit in many decades As a reminder  the deficit is a snapshot of one years fiscal outlook Its the shortfall between what the government spends and what the government collects in taxes and other revenues The White House press office told us that the proof is in the numbers They tracked the deficit as a percent of the entire economy  measured as the Gross Domestic Product In 2009  the first year of Obamas presidency  after tax cuts and new spending  the deficit was 101 percent of GDP In 2012  the deficit declined to 7 percent of GDP So thats a decline of 31 percentage points You have to go back 63 years to the period between 1946 and 1949 to find a bigger four year drop than what the country saw between 2009 and 2012 Right after World War II ended  the US deficit stood at 72 percent of GDP By 1949  America had a surplus of 02 percent So thats a decline of 74 percentage points We downloaded data from the Office of Management and Budget that shows the deficit as a percent of GDP all the way back to 1930 When we ran the numbers  we found  as Obama said  you need to go back to 1946 to find a larger change The numbers game As with any statistics  you have to be careful  and to help us be careful  we contacted five economists and policy analysts The White House simply did a little subtraction to measure the difference between the numbers at the start and the end of the four years There is another option  which is to look at the relative size of the decline So if the deficit went from 101 percent of GDP to 7 percent of GDP  that means the deficit dropped 30 percent  But when we did this going back to World War II  we saw some very strange results Big deficit declines could look smaller in relative terms than small declines Jason Peuquet  research director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget  a bipartisan organization that seeks to reduce deficits faster than the president has done  confirmed that point Peuquet said the administration has the right approach  because relative numbers can make very different changes look the same Peuquet gave the example of a deficit of 1 percent of GDP in the first year and 05 percent after four years That would look like a 50 percent improvement in the level  Peuquet said However  a change in deficits that went from 10 percent of GDP to 5 percent of GDP would also register as a 50 percent improvement   despite being a much larger change in relation to the economy Peuquet and others raised a second statistical issue    choosing the endpoints for the comparison Its a common device to pick the range that best proves your point But in the case of deficit reduction  no one quibbled with the idea that longer periods are more revealing  and Obama used all the years he has available His first year in office was 2009 and the numbers for 2013 are not yet in To the extent that a majority view emerged  economist Alan Auerbach at the University of California Berkeley probably expressed it best There is no singlecorrect way of doing the analysis  Auerbach said  but I would say that their approach is a reasonable one One reason Obama is able to point to an historically high decline is because the deficit as a percent of GDP had never been higher  Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense  an advocacy group focused on taxes and spending  said the reduction is significant But at the same time  he said  Lets face it  there was a lot to reduce The deficit was morbidly obese Similarly  the economy took a major hit which gave it more room for improvement in historic terms So even a moderate recovery has eased the deficit by both increasing tax receipts and reducing demand for government aid such as unemployment support Lastly  while the deficit might decline  the countrys accumulated debt is projected to grow The future path is not captured in snapshots of what happened over the past few years  Peuquet said It ignores the unsustainable debt trajectory the country still faces,0,0,853,real

I dont think so Paul added that Israel has defense capabilities already that are ahead of the countrys potential enemies Pauls phrasing suggested some uncertainty about Israels wealth  so we decided to check it out We discovered that there are several ways to calculate per capita income by country The two major indicators we consulted showed that Israel was safely in the top 25 percent The World Bank calculates per capita income two ways One accounts for purchasing power and one doesnt Purchasing power means that the measurement takes into account how goods are priced in a particular country The World Bank statistics covered about 160 countries and territories If you consider purchasing power  in 2009 Israel was No 25 on the list of countries  with per capita income of  27 110 No 1 was Luxembourg with  59 550 The United States was No 5 with  45 640 If you dont consider purchasing power  Israel is No 23  at  25 790 On this measure  Norway is No 1 at  84 640  and the United States is No 8 at  46 360 Either way  Israel makes the top 40  which puts it in the top 25 percent of the World Bank listings Seeking the broadest possible measure  though  we looked for a more widespread account of how many countries there are in the world The United Nations  for example  says it has 192 members Other sources note that the independence of some countries is contested  so the number can shift depending on world events to anywhere between 191 and 196 countries So even by the larger number of countries  Israel would still be in the top 25 percent,1,0,447,real

By saying that a government shutdown could disrupt  veterans benefits  Stabenow phrased her statement cautiously  and  for the most part  accurately A shutdown is not destined to disrupt checks to veterans  but it could    either for new claims  or  if the shutdown drags on long enough  for existing beneficiaries Stabenow could have added that a shorter shutdown in line with the duration of those in 1995  or a generous allocation of essential employees  could minimize or even eliminate the impact on veterans checks this year But we think thats a minor omission  given how carefully she couched her statement,1,0,725,real
3734,2011-05-11T12:07:43-04:00,2011,wwwwhitehousegov,Barack Obama,The Obama administration increased the deportation of illegal immigrants convicted of crimes by 70 percent,In a speech on immigration reform in El Paso  Texas  President Barack Obama said his administration has focused on deporting illegal immigrants convicted of crimes Beyond the border  were going after employers who knowingly exploit people and break the law  Obama said in the speech on May 10  2011 And we are deporting those who are here illegally And thats a tough issue Its a source of controversy But I want to emphasize were not doing it haphazardly Were focusing our limited resources and people on violent offenders and people convicted of crimes    not just families  not just folks who are just looking to scrape together an income And as a result  weve increased the removal of criminals by 70 percent Obamas claim that under his administration  deportation of criminals increased by 70 percent suggests a significant shift in policy  so we decided to check it out According to data provided by the Department of Homeland Security  the number of illegal immigrants removed  rose about 6 percent     from 369 221 to 392 862     between the end of September 2008  four months before Obama took office  and the end of September 2010 But a much larger percentage of those deported were convicted criminals In 2008  31 percent were criminals  but by 2010  the percentage jumped to 50 percent The raw number of convicted criminals who were deported went from 114 415 in 2008 to 195 772 in 2010 Thats 71 percent So that squares with Obamas claim Data for the first half of the 2011 fiscal year  which began at the end of September  suggests that trend is continuing  with about 52 percent of the deportations involving convicted criminals In an Oct 6  2010  press release   Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the numbers reflect the administrations prioritizing the identification and removal of criminal aliens who pose a threat to public safety Our approach has yielded historic results  removing more convicted criminal aliens than ever before and issuing more financial sanctions on employers who knowingly and repeatedly violate immigration laws than during the entire previous administration  Napolitano said Roy Beck  executive director of NumbersUSA  a group that favors reducing immigration into the United States  said its true that the deportation rate  particularly deportation of convicted criminals  has been higher under Obama My sense is that Obama deserves credit  for all the complaints about him  that he has done maybe a little better than Bush on deportations  Beck said I think the main context  though  is that the amount of deportations under Bush was rather small And even under Obama  Beck said  the administration is talking about fewer than 400 000 deportations in a country with an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants DHS statistics show that under Bush  overall deportations more than tripled between 2001 and 2008    going from 116 782 to 369 221 But in the latter part of Bushs presidency  the biggest jump was in the deportation of illegal immigrants who were were not convicted criminals During the eight years of Bushs presidency  deportation of convicted criminals rose from 71 079 in 2001 to 114 415 in 2008 Thats a 61 percent increase over eight years In the first two years under Obama  the data suggest a policy shift toward prioritizing the deportation of convicted criminals And Obama is correct that there has been a 70 percent increase,0,0,560,real

NEVERHILLARY However  posts with a similar message as this headline also appeared on liberal sites  such as Occupy Democrats  So whats going on with the USA Snich post? Lets take a closer look A legal precedent? The post links to an article published on the Huffington Post It was written by a contributor    not a Huffington Post staff member    named Alex Mohajer  who is identified as political director of Bros4Hillary  a volunteer advocacy organization and the holder of a law degree In the column  Mohajer writes that recent allegations of Russian linked hacking could provide a basis for the federal courts to get involved with the elections outcome  through a case thats little known even among constitutional scholars At least one federal court decision suggests there may be some federal case law on the question of whether it is possible to invalidate the outcome of an election after the fact when there is fraud  and replace a candidate benefitted by fraud with his opponent  he wrote The case  Marks v Stinson  is the first and only known case in which a federal judge reversed an election outcome The 1995 case revolved around allegations that Democrat William G Stinson colluded with election officials to cast illegally obtained absentee ballots In February 1994  after Stinson had taken office  the federal judge ordered him removed and replaced by his opponent  Republican Bruce Marks An appellate court affirmed the district courts intervention in the matter  but it objected to the court seating Marks  although because Marks was already serving  the court allowed him to continue for the remainder of the term Heres the money paragraph  The case offers an interesting rationale that could theoretically be applied in part if  after Donald Trump assumes office  it is shown that Russian hacking  or any fraud  for that matter  robbed Hillary Clinton of the presidency  Mohajer writes The case offers clues that imply courts may intervene This is a novel legal theory We asked Kermit Roosevelt  a constitutional scholar at the University of Pennsylvania  what he thought of it Im pretty confident that theres zero chance of it happening  Roosevelt said I could see a court reversing the result of an election if fraud was proved along the lines of Candidate A really won 150 to 100  but Candidate B fraudulently altered the records to make it look like he won 150 to 100 But thats not what happened No one credible is alleging that the election was affected by that kind of fraud The votes recorded were the votes that were cast They may have been influenced by fake news and Russian propaganda  but theres no judicial remedy for that The USA Snich post In other words  the theory offered in the headline is  at most  the longest of longshots So right off the bat  the headline elevates the urgency of a legal theory of uncertain value that had been advanced by one Clinton supporter The USA Snich post  and the SupremePatriot post  also leave out a lot of cautionary words that Mohajer himself had inserted in his original column While USA Snich did link to the Huffington Post column and reposted several paragraphs of what Mohajer wrote  none of the paragraphs reprinted actually addresses the legal theory underpinning the headlines claim that the courts could overturn the election To find that  a reader would have to click the Huffington Post link  something many readers presumably wont make the effort to do Mohajers column acknowledges some significant questions about the theory Obviously both the stakes and the office in question are much higher than in Marks v Stinson  he wrote There has been no case of first impression with regards to the presidency being overturned to a wrongful winners opponent There is also  of course  no constitutional Electoral College process or system in Pennsylvania  so the situations are not exactly analogous  It is not clear how the case would impact a presidential election When we reached out to Mohajer  he said that being a law school graduate  he thought of the piece as an academic exercise I thought it was an interesting case on election fraud and the only federal court ruling I could find that had a judge replacing an elected official with their opponent from the election because of fraud  Mohajer told PolitiFact It would require courts use a liberal interpretation of the wordfraud and would probably require some wrongdoing by Trump In the interview  Mohajer acknowledged that the likelihood of this scenario occurring is next to lightning striking the same person twice Ultimately  is it plausible? Of course not  he said But If you had asked me 12 months ago whether I thought Donald Trump would elected president  I would have answered in kind with the exact same certainty,3,1,981,fake

15477,2018-06-07T15:12:49-04:00,2018,thefederalistpapersorg,Bloggers,New law  in California  makes it illegal to shower and do laundry on same day,A new fury is circulating on social media over two water conservation laws signed by California Gov Jerry Brown The legislation imposes new restrictions on water use as California recovers from a historic five year drought that ended in April 2017 But several reports inaccurately stated that the laws would punish state residents who use too much water in their everyday routine New law makes it illegal to shower and do laundry on same day  said a June 5  2018  headline from the Federalist Papers Project  a conservative website that has peddled falsehoods before Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebooks News Feed   Read more about our partnership with Facebook  The Federalist Papers Project story references a similar post from conservative website Breitbart   but seems to have gathered most of its information from an article on The Organic Prepper   a blog devoted to preparedness  health  frugality and food  according to its about page Several other websites reposted The Organic Preppers report or wrote similar articles Even US Rep Devin Nunes  R Calif  seemed to push the false narrative online In a blog post   Nunes wrote  Californians dont want to have to choose between doing their laundry and taking a shower  but thats the kind of choice being forced on us The false reports center on two bills   Senate Bill 606 and Assembly Bill 1668   that Brown signed into law May 31  2018 Broadly speaking  the bills instruct cities  water districts and some larger agricultural water districts to establish strict water budgets But the Federalist Papers Project story said the bills would limit California residents to 55 gallons of indoor water use per person per day  beginning in 2022 Violators who use more water than allowed  the story went  would be fined  1 000 per day during normal seasons and  10 000 per day during drought emergencies The story said this limit will turn the most honest  law abiding residents of California into lawbreakers by making it illegal to take a shower and run a load of laundry in a single day Here  the Federalist Papers Project borrowed calculations from The Organic Preppers story  which said the average shower and laundry load use 17 and 40 gallons of water  respectively  for a total of 57 daily gallons   two more gallons than would be allowed were California residents actually limited to 55 gallons of indoor water use per day But that is where the Federalist Papers Project got it wrong  Under the new legislation  Californians will not actually be penalized on an individual basis for excessive water use In reality  the bills stipulate that cities  water districts and large agricultural water districts must come up with budgetary targets for water use by 2022 They will then need to meet their targets across their ratepayer bases  with failure to do so resulting in a fine of  1 000 per day or  10 000 per day during drought emergencies George Kostyrko  director of the office of public affairs for the State Water Resources Control Board  told us the water districts will be guided in their target setting by three standards  one of which is the allowance of 55 gallons per capita per day for indoor residential water use   a number that will drop to 50 gallons by 2030 The other standards  both yet to be determined  will place similar caps on outdoor residential water use and water loss due to system leaks Unfortunately some media outlets have grossly misinterpreted the law  Kostyrko said These are not individual mandates for homeowners  but actually a task given to each water district to average water consumption use out to hit the goal Jim Metropulos  legislative director for state Assemblywoman Laura Friedman  who wrote Assembly Bill 1668  explained that the legislation sets water efficiency goals for water districts and municipalities on the territorial level  but it does not regulate what individual Californians or businesses can and cant do There is nothing in this bill to target households or companies  Metropulos wrote in an email Water use objectives are on territory level of a water agency There is nothing regulating the time a person may shower or when they may or may not do laundry This means that the Federalist Papers Project story was wrong to suggest that water use would be assessed on a daily individual basis The new requirements are for water districts  not individuals  said Katie Hanzlik  press secretary for state Sen Robert Hertzberg  who authored Senate Bill 606 And the number is based on average water use Fines based on consumption will actually be administered to the water agencies that fail to meet their targets  rather than individuals who use too much water on a given day And while a water district could theoretically let those costs shift to individual water bills  any increase in costs assumed by ratepayers would be closer to a few bucks than  1 000 For the record  it is also worth noting that washing machines are more efficient than they used to be  which calls into question some of the water use estimates mentioned in the false reports Daisy Luther  author of The Organic Prepper  told us she got the figures for her storys 57 gallon estimate from Home Water Works   a project from the nonprofit Alliance for Water Efficiency in collaboration with Chicagos Field Museum  The Federalist Papers Project did not respond to a request for comment  The Organic Prepper story reported that an average shower uses 17 gallons of water and an average load of laundry uses 40  and Luther said the 40 gallon figure was listed as the average for older washing machines But most people now own high efficiency laundry machines that use between 15 and 30 gallons per wash  according to Home Water Works  And since it is the average water use per capita that matters  one persons reliance on an older machine would likely be offset by other residents who are not using so much water,0,0,1002,fake
4088,2011-07-11T14:40:33-04:00,2011,wwwnytimescom,Paul Krugman,There are actually half a million fewer government employees now than there were when  President Barack  Obama took office,In the July 11  2011  edition of the New York Times  Paul Krugman    a Nobel Prize winning economist and liberal columnist    noted a statistic about recent trends in government employment He wrote   Everybody knows that President  Barack  Obama tried to stimulate the economy with a huge increase in government spending  and that it didnt work But what everyone knows is wrong Think about it  Where are the big public works projects? Where are the armies of government workers? There are actually half a million fewer government employees now than there were when Mr Obama took office Has government employment really gone down in the past two and a half years? We looked in the databases for the Bureau of Labor Statistics  the federal governments official tabulator of employment statistics We found that between January 2009  when Obama took office  and June 2011  the most recent month available   Krugman was right for overall government employment    the combination of federal  state and local government workers Overall government employment declined by 518 000 workers  or about 23 percent of the January 2009 level So his statistic is correct But the closer you look at the data  the more varied the data becomes First  lets look at federal government employment  which accounts for just 13 percent of all government employment The number of federal workers has increased by 38 000 over the same period    an increase of 14 percent And if you separate out the US Postal Service  the growth was even bigger Non postal federal employment    about 10 percent of all government employment    increased over the same period by 139 000 workers  or 67 percent The decline in government employment clearly wasnt driven by job losses at the federal level It came from state and local government So well look at the trends for those categories here State employment accounts for 23 percent of the government workforce State government payrolls declined by 113 000 over the same period  or 22 percent Within this category  state education workers    who account for a little under half of state workers    actually rose slightly over the period The hits were taken in the remainder of the state workforce    a decline of 115 500  or 41 percent But the biggest declines in the government sector came in local government Local government    which accounts for 64 percent of all government employment    fell by 443 000 workers  or 3 percent That accounts for a huge portion of the half million decrease in jobs that Krugman cited Education workers at the local level fared worse than those at the state level Local education workers declined by 204 800  or 25 percent Non education workers in local government fared even worse    employment was down 238 400  or 37 percent The decline in government workers has certainly had an impact on the overall employment picture Since the recession officially ended in June 2009  private payrolls have increased by more than 1 million workers  but government payrolls have declined by 493 000    cutting the number of jobs created almost in half So how does all this relate to Krugmans comment? The fact that federal employment outside the Postal Service has risen by 67 percent in the past two and a half years is an important point to recognize for anyone studying employment trends But Krugman was careful enough to avoid suggesting that federal employment declined by a half million jobs In fact  since a large chunk of the stimulus came in the form of aid to states    specifically to help save jobs in education and other government sectors    using total government employment figures as a yardstick seems reasonable to us,4,0,606,real

Senate Historian Donald Ritchie told us that amending the Constitution is an extremely complicated process and an amendment essentially only gets adopted when theres a broad national consensus on the issue University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt agreed  noting that the founders wanted the bar set high because they believed that most issues should be left to the ordinary political process A constitutional amendment takes an issue away from the normal process of democratic politics  quite likely forever So it makes sense to require an extraordinary consensus to resolve it permanently Most proposals arent inspired by a broad national consensus  however The motivation for introducing a constitutional amendment is often political Every time the Supreme Court makes a ruling some member of Congress doesnt like  someone pushes for a constitutional amendment on the matter  Ritchie told us For example  the day after the Supreme Court ruled flag burning to be protected speech in 1989  US Rep Michael Bilirakis  R Fla  introduced an amendment outlawing desecration of the flag  Amendments to ban flag burning have been introduced in every session of Congress since  spanning more than two decades Many amendments are introduced many times An amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman has been introduced numerous times in the last decade  including four times in a single session of Congress  Some are introduced many times but with variations Following the terrorist attacks of Sept 11  2001  members of Congress introduced amendments that would provide for the continuity of Congress in the event of a sudden mass vacancy in the Capitol  The amendments varied on what constituted that mass vacancy and how replacement lawmakers would be chosen None of the amendments passed Back to Becerra He was correct that only a tiny percentage of amendments ultimately pass and are ratified He said 11 000  the official count puts the number at approximately 11 372 Thats close enough to earn a True,2,0,643,real

She answered   I havent talked about it because I dont know if its because Im remembering it through a dream or I   Im not sure  but yes  I feel like I saw it after that happened  but I havent spoken about it because of that Jack Cashill  co editor of the Sentinel  told PolitiFact that he didnt have the full deposition and relied on excerpts in the court filing It is for this reason I used the subjunctive in the headlinemay have   he said  noting that other news outlets including the Daily Mail used a similar approach in headlines Greitens has seized on the dream portion of the womans statement  telling media that the case is a political witch hunt now based on the testimony of somebody who said under oath that they may be remembering this through a dream Other news reports state that that the womans testimony came during a deposition that lasted for several hours The Associated Press wrote that the prosecutor in the case says the defensecherry picked bits and pieces of her nine hour deposition and the womans attorney says the comment referred to one particular instance concerning the photo The Missouri House committee investigation into the allegations against Greitens also mentioned the dream comment  but stated in a footnote that the committee includes these quotes in the absence of a full transcript from the deposition The woman told the committee that during an encounter with Greitens  I can hear like a  like a cell phone   like a picture  and I can see a flash through the blindfold The committee concluded that the woman was a credible witness Greitens did not testify before the House committee St Louis Circuit Judge Rex Burlison issued a gag order in the case which prohibits comments related to the deposition and requires the judge to sign off on certain court filings before theyre made public Without the deposition  we cant fully evaluate the womans comments The womans attorney  Scott Simpson  said in statement to media that the woman supports the release of the full transcript Simpson said that Greitens has admitted to my client  on multiple occasions that he took her photograph without her consent  and threatened to release it if she ever told anyone about their relationship,2,0,617,real

13136,2016-09-27T01:26:46-04:00,2016,wwwwashingtonpostcom,Hillary Clinton,According to independent experts  Donald Trumps tax plan would blow up the debt by over  5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle class families compared to the wealthy,During the first presidential debate of 2016  Hillary Clinton took aim at Donald Trumps latest tax plan  saying it would explode the debt and hike taxes for some middle class Americans Independent experts have looked at what Ive proposed and looked at what Donalds proposed  and basically theyve said this  that  his tax plan  would blow up the debt by over  5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle class families compared to the wealthy  Clinton said The Clinton campaign pointed us to an analysis by Lily L Batchelder  a professor at New York University Law School When we asked her whether Clintons phrasing accurately summarized her findings  Batchelder said it did Yep  thats totally accurate  she told PolitiFact Well look at the two parts of Clintons statement in turn  focusing on the revised plan Trump unveiled at a speech at the Economic Club of New York on Sept 15  2016  Click the links for details on the plans  Debt increase In her paper  published a little more than a week after Trump offered his revised plan  Batchelder wrote that her calculations suggested that Donald Trumps latest tax plan would cost more than  5 trillion over 10 years One can argue that Batchelder is not an independent expert    she worked for Democratic Sen Max Baucus as chief tax counsel of the Senate Finance Committee from 2010 to 2014 and as the deputy director of the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama in 2014 and 2015 However  a more conservative group  the Tax Foundation   came up with a similar calculation in its own analysis According to its model  Trumps plan would reduce federal revenue    in other words  add to the debt    by between  44 trillion and  59 trillion without taking into account increased economic growth estimates due to the plans tax cuts  The Tax Foundation did note that this debt increase was smaller than what it had projected for earlier versions of Trumps plan  Finally  the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget   a group that favors deficit reduction  wrote that its update found that both Clinton and Trump would increase the debt relative to current law   though Trump would increase it by an order of magnitude more  Specifically  we estimate Clintons plans would add  200 billion to the debt over the next decade  while Trumps plans would add  53 trillion So Clinton seems on solid ground for this part of the statement Tax hikes Batchelders paper is the primary evidence here  along with a separate analysis by a liberal group  Citizens for Tax Justice  Despite its enormous price tag  his plan would actually significantly raise taxes for millions of low  and middle income families with children  with especially large tax increases for working single parents  Batchelder wrote I conservatively estimate that Trumps plan would increase taxes for roughly 78 million families with minor children These families who would pay more taxes represent roughly 20 percent of households with minor children and more than half of single parents They include roughly 25 million individuals and 15 million children Batchelder cites several reasons for why some families would see a tax increase  including Trumps exchange of a new standard deduction for personal exemptions  his repeal of the head of household filing status  which benefits unmarried taxpayers with dependents  his exchange of a 10 percent bracket for a 12 percent bracket  and the reality that his new tax deduction and credit for child care would provide relatively little benefit to low  and middle income caretakers The Tax Foundations report didnt address this issue  noting instead that as a rule  taxpayers in all income groups would see more money in their pocket if Trumps plan was enacted However  the Tax Foundation did find substantially bigger gains for wealthy Americans  which is consistent with Clintons statement that Trumps plan would disadvantage middle class families compared to the wealthy It found that the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers would receive an income bump of between 08 percent and 19 percent  compared to 54 percent to 93 percent for the top 10 percent of taxpayers and between 102 percent and 160 percent for taxpayers in the top 1 percent More to the point  the Tax Foundations Kyle Pomerleau tweeted favorably about Batchelders finding that some taxpayers would experience tax hikes  saying  We were able to replicate many of the numbers in the report The results seem reasonable to me Another tax policy group  the Tax Policy Center  has not released an analysis of Trumps most recent plan The Trump campaign sent us a paper defending the tax proposal However  it was not independent since it was written by a pair of senior policy advisors to the Trump campaign,0,0,782,real

The issues portion of his website doesnt list abortion  but Romney wrote a June 18  2011  op ed in the conservative National Review that lays out his abortion views pretty clearly It was written after he risked alienating anti abortion activists by declining to sign a pledge offered by the Susan B Anthony List  an anti abortion group I am pro life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape  incest  or to save the life of the mother I support the reversal of Roe v Wade  because it is bad law and bad medicine Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench I support the Hyde Amendment  which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions And as president  I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood  which primarily performs abortions or offers abortion related services I will reinstate the Mexico City Policy to ensure that nongovernmental organizations that receive funding from America refrain from performing or promoting abortion services as a method of family planning  in other countries  This includes ending American funding for any United Nations or other foreign assistance program that promotes or performs abortions on women around the world I will advocate for and support a Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain from abortion And perhaps most importantly  I will only appoint judges who adhere to the Constitution and the laws as they are written  not as they want them to be written,1,0,551,real

11399,2015-10-07T17:40:15-04:00,2015,wwwyoutubecom,Club for Growth,Says Donald Trump supports eminent domain and the Supreme Courts Kelo decision,Slinging any pebbles they can find at the larger than life Donald Trump  some Republicans are taking the real estate mogul to task over his support for a legal concept called eminent domain Eminent domain is the governments power to seize private property in order to make way for public development projects  such as highways or schools Some conservatives oppose eminent domain because they see it as a breach of property rights A recent ad by Club for Growth   a conservative anti tax group  attacks Trump for his support of the practice and a related 2005 Supreme Court decision The Supreme Courts Kelo decision gave the government massive new power to take private property and give it to corporations  the ads narrator says Conservatives have fought this disaster Whats Donald Trump say about the decision? The narration cuts to audio of Trump giving an interview to Fox News I happen to agree with it 100 percent  Trump said The narration picks back up  Trump supports eminent domain abuse because he can make millions while we lose our property rights Is Trump an eminent domain supporter  and does he agree with the Kelo vs New London  Conn decision that many conservatives deride? Club for Growth described it as eminent domain abuse    but whether the practice counts as abuse is a matter of opinion Trump and Kelo The 2005 Kelo case concerned the government of New London  Conn  which wanted to seize several privately owned homes in order to open up the area for a major commercial development project intended to revitalize the struggling city Several residents who didnt want to lose their homes  including a nurse named Susette Kelo  sued and argued that this proposal went beyond the governments eminent domain powers In a liberal majority 5 4 decision   the Supreme Court found in New Londons favor While eminent domain traditionally involves a proposal for a public    as in government run    work  this decision said eminent domain could be used to make way for private commercial development The idea was that the development qualified as a public use because it would bring jobs and tax revenues to a blighted area At the time  Trump said he agreed with the decision  even though it was controversial We found the July 19  2005  transcript of the interview quoted in Club for Growths ad Heres an excerpt of the conversation between Trump and Foxs Neil Cavuto  Cavuto  What did you think of that decision? Was the court overdoing it with that decision? Trump  Well  its sort of not a good one for me to say  because I noticed every article written about it said Will Donald Trump take over your home? sort of using me as the example  Neil And its sort of    its an interesting situation to be in But I happen to agree with it 100 percent  not that I would want to use it But the fact is  if you have a person living in an area thats not even necessarily a good area  and government  whether its local or whatever  government wants to build a tremendous economic development  where a lot of people are going to be put to work and make an area thats not good into a good area  and move the person thats living there into a better place    now  I know it might not be their choice    but move the person to a better place and yet create thousands upon thousands of jobs and beautification and lots of other things  I think it happens to be good As Trump acknowledges  he is somewhat of a poster boy for the pitfalls of eminent domain because of a high profile case involving his property In the late 1990s  Trump wanted to build a limousine garage to service one of his casinos in Atlantic City  NJ  but several pieces of private property were in the way    including a home owned by a woman named Vera Coking When Coking refused to give her property up for Trump  New Jerseys casino reinvestment authority tried to seize the house instead The dispute ended up in front of a New Jersey court  which ruled against Trump and the government Media regularly cited the case as an example of failed eminent domain during coverage of the Kelo case a few years later So Trump supported eminent domain back in the mid 2000s  but what does he think of it now? His current views It appears Trump holds the same position as he did back then On Oct 6  2015  Foxs Bret Baier asked Trump  What do you think of eminent domain? I think eminent domain is wonderful  Trump responded  adding that as a builder  he knows better than anybody how frustrating it can be when youre building a project  and one property holds out and refuses to sell And you need a house in a certain location because youre going to build this massive development thats going to employ thousands of people Or youre going to build a factory that without this little house  you cant build the factory  he said I think eminent domain is fine Baier pushed Trump specifically on whether he still supports the Kelo decision Trump did not respond directly to that question  though he reinforced his support for eminent domain in general and acknowledged that his position differs from that of many conservatives I think its a great subject    its a very interesting subject  Trump said I fully understand the conservative approach  but I dont think it was explained to most conservatives,7,0,923,real

lawsuit against the Trump administration over its decision to rescind a deferred deportation program  claiming the move is discriminatory and that the program itself has not been ruled unconstitutional US Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Sept 5 the end for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  DACA    an Obama era program that protected from deportation immigrants who came to the United States as children and live here illegally The lawsuit from Schneiderman and 15 other attorneys general contends the administrations action discriminates against Mexican immigrants  who account for 78 percent of DACA recipients Trump since his campaigning days has flagrantly displayed an anti Latino  particularly anti Mexican discriminatory animus  Schneiderman said on MSNBCs The Rachel Maddow Show This is a massively successful program There is no good reason to shut it down Theres no legitimate reason to shut it down No court has held it unconstitutional  Schneiderman said Sept 6 Weve heard lots of competing claims from lawmakers   pundits and others that walk the line between fact and opinion regarding the constitutionality of DACA Schneidermans claim is clearly stated as a fact We found that he is right  DACAs constitutionality has not been determined by courts DACA created by 2012 DHS memo DACA is based on a June 2012 memorandum issued by Janet Napolitano  then Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Napolitanos memo outlined prosecutorial discretion so that resources would be used to remove immigrants who met the departments priorities and protect from deportation young immigrants who met specific criteria Napolitano said immigration laws were not designed to be blindly enforced without considering individual cases and circumstances Nor are they designed to remove productive young people to countries where they may not have lived or even speak the language Indeed  many of these young people have already contributed to our country in significant ways Prosecutorial discretion  which is used in so many other areas  is especially justified here  Napolitano wrote DACA is a policy  but it is not a law It also does not grant legal immigration status to the approximately 800 000 people who were approved for the program Many have argued that creating DACA through the executive brach  rather than through the legislative process is an overreach of executive power No court ruling on constitutionality of DACA Theres debate among experts on whether DACA is constitutional or not  but there is agreement that a court ruling on the constitutionality of the program has not been issued There has been no court decision holding that DACA itself is unconstitutional  Anil Kalhan  an associate professor of law at Drexel University A lawsuit to challenge the 2012 DACA was dismissed for lack of standing  and that decision was upheld by the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit  Kalhan said So there was never any adjudication on the merits  he said To my knowledge  no court has ruled DACA 2012 as unconstitutional and the one to even reach the court was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds  concurred Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia  a law professor and director of the Center for Immigrants Rights Clinic at Pennsylvania State University Wadhia and more than 100 other immigration law professors and scholars wrote a letter to Trump providing legal analysis on the executive branchs legal authority to implement DACA Other experts from the University of California also told us courts have not stricken down DACA as unconstitutional Its a straightforward fact that no court has declared DACA unconstitutional and that the one appellate court that considered a related program declined to address the issue  said Amy Spitalnick  spokeswoman for Schneiderman Texas and 25 other states won a lawsuit against the Obama administration by having a federal district judge block the implementation of an expanded version of the 2012 DACA and of another deportation reprieve program  Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents  DAPA  An appeals court upheld the ruling  and in 2016 the Supreme Court ruled 4 4 on the case  leaving in place the lower courts ruling But when those programs were temporarily enjoined by the district court in Texas  it was not on constitutional grounds  Kalhan said  but rather based on a conclusion that Obama administration should have instituted the policy using notice and comment rule making  rather than using the more informal guidance document that it issued A final  binding precedent even on that basis was not set either  since it was only a preliminary injunction and the Supreme Court deadlocked  Kalhan said And even then  some aspects of DAPA and the DACA expansion may be different from DACA in relevant ways that bear on legality it has never been fully established the two programs stand on identical legal footing  Kalhan said,0,0,791,real
11627,2015-11-24T17:51:18-05:00,2015,berniesanderscom,Bernie Sanders,Instead of fighting ISIS   the Saudis  have focused more on a campaign to oust Iran backed Houthi rebels in Yemen,Bernie Sanders delivered his long awaited speech on democratic socialism last week  also outlining his plan for fighting ISIS Sanders called for a broad international coalition but stressed that Muslim nations must shoulder the fight  which he called a struggle for the soul of Islam So far  he said  wealthy and powerful countries in the region like Saudi Arabia  Kuwait  Qatar  and the United Arab Emirates have done very little Saudi Arabia  turns out  has the third largest defense budget in the world  Sanders said on Nov 19  Yet instead of fighting ISIS they have focused more on a campaign to oust Iran backed Houthi rebels in Yemen Sanders is correct that Saudi Arabias military budget is the third largest in the world But is he also right that the Saudis arent prioritizing ISIS? In a word  yes A striking scaleback The Saudi embassy in Washington did not return our requests for comment But the Sanders campaign forwarded us a New York Times article that says  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have shifted most of their aircraft to their fight against Iranian backed Houthi rebels in Yemen In 2014  the Houthis   a longstanding Shiite separatist group in northern Yemen  a country with a Sunni majority   rebelled against the Yemeni government and seized the presidential palace After months of tense peace brokered by the United Nations  the Houthis took over the government and placed the president under house arrest in early 2015 Saudi Arabia  which has a Sunni majority and is ruled by a Sunni monarch  led a 10 state Arab coalition and launched airstrikes against the Houthis on March 26 It pledged to use 100 warplanes and 150 000 soldiers In a month  the Saudis conducted 2 415 sorties  a deployment of an aircraft   releasing at least 1 000 air to ground weapons Meanwhile  as part of the US led coalition of 60 countries  Saudi Arabia has also been involved with the international effort against ISIS since September 2014 Since then  it has deployed just four F 15 fighter jets and an unspecified number of Typhoon combat jets against ISIS  Saudi state media trumpeted the participation  releasing photos of pilots who flew in the strikes and highlighting that the son of King Salman was among them  Experts said Saudi Arabia doesnt publicize the exact number of airstrikes it has carried out  but the data shows that the amount of non US airstrikes overall has been scaled back since the Saudi led intervention in Yemen began in late March Conversely  the United States has beefed up its strikes Heres a chart from Airwarsorg   a project tracking the international air war against ISIS  that demonstrates this point  Data compiled by Airwarsorg shows that from Dec 1  2014  to Nov 16  2015  Arab allies conducted just 143 of the 2 827 airstrikes in Syria  90 of which occurred before April 3  intervention in Yemen began March 26  For comparison  Saudi Arabia sometimes conducted as many as 125 strikes a day against the Houthis  according to the BBC  Bottom line  Bernie Sanders is right All the evidence points to it  said Chris Woods  an investigative journalist who leads the Airwars project Clearly  we saw with the Saudis a capability unleashed in Yemen that we never saw in Syria The volume of Saudi military forces deployed to combat the Houthis puts the Saudi deployment against ISIS to shame  said David Weinberg  an expert on the Gulf monarchies at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracy Weinberg looked at tallies from the Defense Department which are consistent with Airwarsorg data He also noted a decline in the number of non US airstrikes in Syria and a pitiful lack of participation by Americas Arab allies in what was supposedly unveiled as a joint US Arab effort when it was launched last fall According to the New York Times article cited by the Sanders campaign  the Saudis flew their last strikes in Syria in September  Jordan in August  and the UAE in March Conflicting crises Riyadh has its reasons for prioritizing the Houthis over ISIS Among them  Yemens proximity   Irans gains in the region   sectarianism and  simply put  practicality Yemen is the soft underbelly of the kingdom  and Iranian presence there through its support of Houthis is viewed as an existential threat to the kingdom  said David Ottaway  the Middle East specialist at the Woodrow Wilson Center In the end  Syria doesnt border Saudi Arabia like Yemen does  said Lori Plotkin Boghardt of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy And more fundamentally  the Saudis view Assad as the root of the ISIS problem and have argued from the beginning that Assad has to be defeated first in order to defeat ISIS Saudi Arabia is also somewhat relying on the United States to take on ISIS  added Weinberg of the Defense of Democracies Its also politically easier for the Sunni kingdom to mobilize public opinion there against radical Shiites like the Houthis rather than radical Sunni terrorists like ISIS  he said The United States  for its part  supports the Saudi led intervention in Yemen  the Houthis slogan is Death to America  Death to Israel  Damn the Jews  Victory to Islam   despite concerns over civilian casualties and possible war crimes Whats more  Boghardt pointed out  the irony and the danger is that the conflict in Yemen has given al Qaida and ISIS room to operate there As for ISIS  theres no question that the Saudis are aware of the threat it poses The terrorist group has repeatedly targeted the kingdom  bombing mosques and detonating car bombs  Beyond military engagement  the Saudis have foiled terrorist plots and arrested hundreds of ISIS supporters But experts say the kingdom could be doing a lot more Saudi Arabia really should be doing more to militarily combat the twin scourges of ISIS and al Qaida  Weinberg said Bernie Sanders is right that we should expect more from our Saudi allies in the fight against terror in Syria as well as beyond,1,0,999,real

Angle replies  I would like to go through to the elimination We wanted to look through the rest of the interview to make sure that Angle really does believe that the department should be eliminated First  a little background on the Education Department Its budget for fiscal year 2010 is about  64 billion Of this  nearly  27 billion consists of Pell Grants  which fund disadvantaged students in college and graduate school Another  25 billion is authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act  including funding to K 12 school systems around the country An additional  12 billion comes from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  which helps fund education for disabled K 12 students Much of the remainder is spent on educational research We went to the archived interview and found that the ad doesnt distort her view Heres a transcript of the relevant portion of the interview  I believe that anything that isnt a federally governed  enumerated power in the Constitution  which means the federal government should be paying out on this  is up for grabs here  she said And we have some departments like the Department of Education that passes down policy  one size fits all  that fits no one Like No Child Left Behind We need to keep those education dollars right here in the state and put them where they will do the most good  which is right in that clasroom  with that classroom teacher We need to cut down on those bureaucracies that take those educational dollars that should be going into that classroom And it angers me every time I hear  politicians  say were going to cut teachers  she continued What about the agencies that never see a child  never have been in a classroom  that are passing down policy that actually overburdens our classrooms What about those? Why dont we cut there? Thats when the host interjects Would you eliminate the Department of Education or simply cut it back? Angle responds  I would like to go through to the elimination I think we start by defunding it  and the reason that we should eliminate it is because its not the federal governments job to provide education for our children Its a 10th Amendment right It should be done here in the state  and it should be done as close to the local as possible Reviewing the exchange on KNPR  it seems to us that the ad portrayed Angles stance accurately She did not hesitate  backtrack or give any indication that she misspoke  even when the host gave her the opportunity to roll back the scope of her proposal Shes expressed that position before  in a Mar 22  2010  interview with the conservative website Nevada News   Views  when she said she would like to eliminate not just the Education Department but the Energy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency as well Its worth noting that theres been a long running constitutional debate about whether the Education Department is legitimate Erwin Chemerinsky  the liberal dean of the University of California  Irvine  law school  argues that its proper because of Congress spending power Ilya Shapiro of the libertarian Cato Institute counters that the 10th Amendments assigning of all unlisted powers to the states makes it  plain and obvious that there is no constitutional authority for it Regardless  on the issue raised by Reids ad    whether Sharron Angle would eliminate the Department of Education    we found that yes  she did say she wanted to do so in several public forums,4,0,712,real
2258,2010-08-19T14:56:25-04:00,2010,republicansforeignaffairshousegov,Ileana Ros Lehtinen,US taxpayers are being forced to fund Feisal Abdul Raufs trip to the Middle East,As the high voltage battle over the Ground Zero Mosque was raging on Aug 10  2010  two Republican lawmakers    Florida Rep Ileana Ros Lehtinen  the ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee  and New York Rep Peter King  the ranking member on the House Homeland Security Committee    took aim at the State Department for allegedly footing the bill for foreign travel by the imam behind the proposed center in lower Manhattan It is unacceptable that US taxpayers are being forced to fund Feisal Abdul Raufs trip to the Middle East  the lawmakers wrote  Abdul Rauf has cast blame for 9 11 on the US  and even refuses to call Hamas what it is    a Foreign Terrorist Organization This radical is a terrible choice to be one of the faces of our country overseas The US should be using public diplomacy programs to combat extremism  not endorse it The State Departments selection of Feisal Abdul Rauf to represent the American people through this program further calls into question the Administrations policy and funding priorities Were separately looking at other aspects of the controversy here  including some elements of what Ros Lehtinen and King said in their statement But in this item  we wanted to look at the narrow question of whether the lawmakers were correct that US taxpayers are being forced to fund Feisal Abdul Raufs trip to the Middle East At an Aug 10  2010  State Department briefing  Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs PJ Crowley confirmed that a program under the State Departments auspices    the Bureau of International Information Programs    is paying for Raufs trip Imam Faisal will be traveling to Qatar  Bahrain  and the UAE on a US government sponsored trip to the Middle East  Crowley said He will discuss Muslim life in America and religious tolerance  We have about 1 200 of these kinds of programs every year  of sending experts in all fields overseas Last year we had 52 trips that were specifically focused on religious    promoting religious tolerance We will expect to have roughly the same number of  programs this year On Aug 18  2010  Fox News and the Associated Press   citing the State Department  reported that Rauf will be paid  3 000 directly by the US government and that the government will pay for his airfare  lodging and expenses The total amount for sending Rauf overseas will be roughly  16 000 Crowley noted that this will be Raufs fourth trip overseas on the governments dime  including two of them under the administration of former President George W Bush and one earlier this year In 2007  he visited Bahrain  Morocco  the UAE and Qatar  Crowley said And earlier this year  in January  he also visited Egypt So we have a long term relationship with him You know  his work on tolerance and religious diversity is well known and he brings a moderate perspective to foreign audiences on what its like to be a practicing Muslim in the United States And our discussions with him about taking this trip preceded the current debate in New York over the center So Ros Lehtinen is correct that the federal government  and  therefore  US taxpayers  will be funding Raufs trip to the Middle East Some commentators have gone a step further by saying the trip is tantamount to a fundraising jaunt for Raufs center The Washington Times editorial page wrote that by funding the trip so soon after New York Citys Landmarks Preservation Commission gave the go ahead to demolish the building on the proposed mosque site  the State Department is creating the appearance that the US government is facilitating the construction of this shameful structure It gives Mr Rauf not only access but imprimatur to gather up foreign cash And because Mr Rauf  has refused to reveal how he plans to finance his costly venture  the American public is left with the impression it will be a wholly foreign enterprise Crowley  in his Aug 10 briefing  was asked about the fundraising issue He knocked down the notion It is something that we have talked to him about  and we have informed him about our prohibition against fundraising while on a speaking tour  Crowley said We do not expect him to fundraise We arent rating this claim  because we dont believe its provable either way that the trip will offer fundraising opportunities On the one hand  the government has made clear that fundraising cannot take place during the trip On the other hand  its possible that the trip  indirectly  will raise Raufs profile with people who hear him speak in Qatar  Bahrain  and the UAE and  in the process  ease future fundraising for his planned center But while were not taking sides on the fundraising question  we believe that the less far reaching statement by Ros Lehtinen is accurate US taxpayers are indeed funding Raufs trip  as they have his prior two trips to the region Its worth noting that the decision to sponsor his trip was made before the current controversy became the focus of media attention  and also that Rauf took his first State Department funded trip during the Bush administration rather than Barack Obama But none of those facts undercut the statement we checked by Ros Lehtinen,0,0,873,real

Among men 64 and older  the poverty rate in 1939 was 78 percent For women  it was 775 percent But what about 1935? Even  78  would probably be a slightly conservative estimate since poverty for all persons in 1939 was considerably lower in 1939 than in 1935  Smolensky wrote us in an e mail He said that by his estimates  in 1935  the poverty rate for all families was 694 percent For the elderly  it could have been up to 20 percent higher Still  the paper also notes that due to changes in the survey methodology  data presented here for 1939 are not directly comparable to the data for later years We also looked at research from Robert Plotnick  professor of public affairs at University of Washington Plotnick and his colleagues  including Smolensky  extended the poverty threshold  adjusting for inflation  back to 1914 In 1935  the poverty rate for the entire US population was 649 percent Plotnick told us that he does not have a breakdown by age  but since poverty among elders was consistently higher than for the overall population until the mid 1970s  it would be reasonable to assume poverty among the elders in 1935 was at least 50 percent We asked Johnsons office for a source for the claim and were told that it comes from material that references Growing Old in America  a 1978 publication by David Fischer  now a history professor at Brandeis University Page 226 contains the statistic that Johnson may have been talking about  Dependent poverty among the old grew inexorably  from 23 percent in 1910 to 40 percent in 1930  and 50 percent in 1935 The term dependent poverty puzzled us  and we tried to reach Fischer to clarify what he meant by that  but he did not respond to our query Plotnick said it is not a standard term currently used in academic literature After some research  we did find an instance of the term in the writings of Thomas Malthus  the 19th Century English economist known for the Malthusian theory that population  left unchecked  outstrips food supplies and leads to disaster Malthus used dependent poverty to describe someone who depends upon charity for survival That may be similar to what Johnson was talking about  but it is not the same concept During her speech  she specifically referenced the US poverty rate  which is a formal term from the US Census We talked to some of the top researchers in this field  and they all agreed  the best estimates show that the elderly poverty rate in 1935 was probably somewhere in the range of 70 to 90 percent So  to review  Johnson said that in 1935  more than 50  of the elderly population lived in poverty Today that poverty rate stands officially at 94  We found no official statistics for the rate of elderly poverty for the year 1935  only academic projections  and making apples to apples comparisons between eras is difficult But those estimates indicate that Johnson may have seriously underestimated the level of poverty for older Americans amid the Great Depression Still  Johnsons underlying point stands The poverty rate among the elderly has dramatically declined Whether that was the result of Social Security or other factors is beyond the scope of this review By the best available measures the rate in 1935 was  as she stated  more than 50 percent And she was just a fraction off on the current level of 97 percent,2,0,931,real

But is there any evaluation the armed services conduct upfront? In addition to an aptitude test  as part of the initial screening  military officials review the medical records of potential service members for their mental health history Col Rebecca I Porter  chief of the behavioral health division of the Office of the Armys Surgeon General  told the Washington Post that the application process includes a review of whatever medical records we have available  as well as asking potential soldiers to complete questionnaires where they might disclose information We look for past diagnoses or past treatments  or other indicators of behavioral problems Porter said a past suicide attempt  mood disorders like depression or bipolar disorders or drug abuse could all preclude someone from gaining admittance to one of the service branches But much of that review requires the individual to have a documented medical history or to offer information that they may have problems Such an admission would likely mean they would not be accepted People who want to come into the Army are no fools  Dr Elspeth Ritchie  a former chief psychiatrist in the Army  told the Los Angeles Times They know if you say you had a past suicide attempt  youre probably not going to get in A recent study from the medical journal JAMA Psychiatry conducted in consultation with the US Army found 1 in 5 servicemembers had a mental health disorder before they even enlisted Once enlisted  however  service members are prone to frequent mental health evaluations before and after deployment We have a series of evaluation of any soldier  sailor  airman  Marine  Coast Guardsman whos deployed prior to their deployment  Retired Lieutenant General Eric Schoomaker told NPR They have access to mental health and physical health care providers  as well  while theyre on deployment And when they return from deployment  within 30 days of their being redeployed  they have another series of examinations with the help of their small unit leader down range  which is then married up with further assessments that take place when they hit the ground back at home station Mental health evaluations can also be recommended by the overseeing officer  If the chain of command becomes aware of a change in the soldiers behavior  he can ask the soldier to be seen at a behavioral health clinic  Porter said in her Post interview Or if a commander had questions about a soldiers fitness for duty  they could do a command directed mental health evaluation  in which case a soldier is referred for evaluation with the understanding that the behavioral health provider will provide feedback to the commander Not everyone in the military community agrees that a mental health evaluation upfront would be helpful Schoomaker  a surgeon in the Army until 2012  recently told the Los Angeles Times that such a process would just lead to driving the problems further underground,2,0,990,real

everything to lose if Donald Trump becomes president  says a recent ad out of Democratic candidate Hillary Clintons campaign Trump management was charged with discriminating against African Americans and breaking federal law  the ads narrator says The Clinton campaign has run the ad on cable television in Florida  North Carolina  Ohio and Pennsylvania There has been a lot of reporting on the subject of the Republican nominees discrimination lawsuits  so we decided it was about time we looked  too We found that the government did  in fact  charge Trump and his real estate company with discrimination  in violation of the Civil Rights Act Back in 1973  Trump was president of his fathers realty company  Trump Management  which operated nearly 40 apartment buildings comprised of about 14 000 residences total  mostly in New York City In October of that year  the federal government filed a complaint against Trump  his father Fred Trump  and Trump Management The complaint alleged that the Trumps violated the Fair Housing Act  part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968  by discriminating against tenants and potential tenants based on their race The defendants  through the actions of their agents and employees  have discriminated against persons because of race in the operation of their apartment buildings  the complaint reads Trump and the government eventually settled the claim  so Trump never admitted guilt  but documents prepared by the government describe numerous allegations of race based discrimination at more than 15 different Trump Management properties Many of the incidents involved a black person being told the complex had no availability when apartments were in fact available For example  one black man asked about two bedroom apartments at Trumps Westminster complex in Brooklyn  and a superintendent told him nothing was available That was March 18  1972 On March 19  1972  the black mans wife  who was white  visited the complex and was offered an application for a two bedroom apartment on the spot The government lawyers also interviewed several people who said executives for Trump Management discouraged rental agents from renting to black people In one case  the government claimed the Trump Management comptroller instructed one rental agent to attach a sheet of paper that said C for colored to every application submitted by a person of color Another rental agent said Fred Trump told him to encourage black tenants to find other housing in order to decrease the black population at that particular complex Donald Trump called the charges absolutely ridiculous  according to the New York Times article that originally reported the charges back in 1973 Trump and his company filed a countersuit the following December  claiming the government made baseless charges and asking for  100 million in damages The court dismissed the countersuit Trumps campaign did not respond to our requests for comment  but they have continued to deny the charges in recent comments to other news outlets  Trump and the government settled the case in 1975 Trump Management agreed to train employees about their obligations under the Fair Housing Act and to launch a two year marketing program to inform the community about their fair housing practices  including giving a weekly list of vacancies to the New York Urban League  among other requirements Trump saw the settlement as a success  writing in his 1987 memoir   Art of the Deal   In the end  the government couldnt prove its case  and we ended up taking a minor settlement without admitting any guilt Instead  we agreed to do some equal opportunity advertising of vacancies in the local newspaper And that was the end of the suit Experts told us that settlements dont mean the parties involved are innocent  though The government settles north of 98 percent of these kinds of housing discrimination cases  and often fairly quickly  said Robert Schwemm  law professor at the University of Kentucky and an expert in housing discrimination law And in every settlement  the agreement allows the defendant to say theyre agreeing to take voluntary action to remedy the problem without admitting guilt That doesnt mean there wasnt lots of evidence against Trump  Schwemm said The government brought their suit against Trump five years after the Civil Rights Act went into effect There was plenty of race based housing discrimination nationwide at that time  Schwemm said But the government had limited resources dedicated to this issue  so government attorneys prioritized bringing complaints against big pattern cases that they believed would have a broader impact Schwemm said of the 20 to 30 Fair Housing Act cases the government brought against fair housing providers in the first five years  hes only aware of two in New York  including Trumps  and very few others in cities outside the southern United States A lot of the housing discrimination at that time was subtle   like taking a black persons rental application and just never looking at it The more blatant sort of discrimination alleged in Trumps case  that they coded applications based on race  was not unheard of but pretty extreme  Schwemm said In 1978  the government wrote a letter to Trumps lawyers saying they believed the company had violated the settlement by steering black tenants to specific properties  according to the  New York Times  But the government ultimately didnt pursue the case before the settlement terms expired,0,0,880,real

ABC This Week host George Stephanopoulos presented White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes with a list of politicians criticizing Obama for his Nov 12 remarks Republican presidential candidate and New Jersey Gov Chris Christie  for example  said Obama sees the world as a fantasy Rhodes said Obama was talking about a particular aspect of containment that in no way dismissed the possibility of terrorist attacks in the West The president was responding very specifically to the geographic expansion of ISIL in Iraq and Syria  Rhodes said  using another acronym for the group A year ago  we saw them on the march in Iraq and Syria  taking more and more population centers The fact is that we have been able to stop that geographic advance and take back significant amounts of territory in both northern Iraq and northern Syria At the same time  that does not diminish the fact that there is a threat posed by ISIL  not just in those countries but in their aspirations to project power overseas This reminded us of a prior fact check  when Obama said he didnt specifically describe ISIS as a JV team    a statement we rated False because he was clearly talking about the Islamic State at the time We decided to look back at Obamas comments on containing ISIS to see his comments in their complete context Rewind In the context of Obamas Nov 12 interview with Stephanopoulos    the day before the Paris attacks    its actually quite clear that when he says ISIS is contained  he is talking about ISISs territorial expansion in Syria and Iraq Here are the relevant parts of the interview  Stephanopoulos  Some of your critics say  even your friendly critics say  like Fareed Zakaria  that what you have on the ground now is not going to be enough Every couple of months youre going to be faced with the same choice of back down or double down Obama  I think what is true is that this has always been a multiyear project precisely because the governance structures in the Sunni areas of Iraq are weak  and there are none in Syria And we dont have ground forces there in sufficient numbers to simply march into Al Raqqah in Syria and clean the whole place out And as a consequence  weve always understood that our goal has to be militarily constraining ISILs capabilities  cutting off their supply lines  cutting off their financing at the same time as were putting a political track together in Syria and fortifying the best impulses in Baghdad so that we can  not just win militarily  but also win by improving governance Stephanopoulos  And thats the strategy youve been following But ISIS is gaining strength  arent they? Obama  Well  no  I dont think theyre gaining strength What is true is that from the start  our goal has been first to contain  and we have contained them They have not gained ground in Iraq And in Syria theyll come in  theyll leave But you dont see this systematic march by ISIL across the terrain What we have not yet been able to do is to completely decapitate their command and control structures Weve made some progress in trying to reduce the flow of foreign fighters When Obama said we have contained them  its within a plainly defined scope  ISISs territorial ambitions in Iraq and Syria This context is bolstered by the fact that Stephanopoulos asks Obama about the ground efforts in those two countries He wasnt saying  as critics have shorthanded  that ISIS no longer presents a threat    an assertion that the Paris attacks would have negated In fact  in the same interview  Obama acknowledged that ISIS might have surpassed al Qaida as the greatest terror threat in the world  adding that they are constantly looking for a crack in the system to exploit to carry out attacks I think that one of the challenges of these international terrorist organizations is that they dont have to have a huge amount of personnel  Obama said Is ISIS contained in Iraq and Syria? The region Obama refers to is significant because its the epicenter of ISISs caliphate We surveyed a number of experts  and they all said Obama is accurate when he says ISIS hasnt gained territory in Iraq and Syria in recent months  though it does not give a full picture of ISISs global reach Its a choice of words that isnt great  but what he is referring to    as opposed to the way people have interpreted it    is correct  said Daveed Gartenstein Ross  senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies While ISIS has captured a couple towns in the past few months  it has ultimately lost roughly a quarter of its Iraq and Syria territory overall A good portion of the losses resulted from United States airstrikes but also from fighting with Iraqi forces and regional groups   Gartenstein Ross said This is a far cry from a year ago  when there was serious concern that ISIS would capture Baghdad But even though they havent expanded territorially recently  ISIS continues to counterattack anti ISIS forces in the region  noted Frederick Kagan  director of the Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute He added that ISIS has actually expanded globally    with strongholds and cells in Libya  Yemen  the Sinai region  and Bangladesh  as well as establishing ties with other terrorist organizations in Africa This November map from the Institute for the Study of War shows where ISIS has ties The stars indicate where ISIS has a remote governorate And  as we know from the Paris attacks  ISIS is able to flex their muscle in the West  too They are being contained geographically by traditional military but they are leapfrogging over it using terrorism  said Joshua Landis  director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma He added that Obama used your grandfathers notion of containment,3,0,1029,real

We checked this fact before  when it was offered by newly elected Sen Pat Toomey  R Pa On the Jan 2  2011  edition of NBCs Meet the Press  host David Gregory asked Toomey for areas where Obama and congressional Republicans could work together I think tax policy is a possible area  one with plenty of landmines but plenty of opportunities  Toomey said  Simplify the code  lower rates We should be lowering corporate tax rates  because we have the highest in the world right now Using the most straightforward definition of corporate tax rates  Toomey is right The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  a group of 32 large  industrialized democracies  ranks the combined corporate income tax rate in its member nations That means the highest tax bracket for general corporate income  excluding taxes levied on specific products or services We found that for 2010  the US ranked second to Japan by a fraction of a percentage point    3954 percent for Japan to 3921 percent for the US But that figure is already outdated  Japan has moved to cut its rate for 2011 by 5 percentage points  leaving the US with the highest corporate tax rate among OECD nations Still  the issue is complicated  so lets delve a bit deeper The OECD rate is the statutory rate    that is  the top corporate tax rate on the books But as Obama indicated  many companies pay considerably less than that  due to deductions and other exclusions Adjusting for these factors produces a statistic called the effective tax rate The World Bank has assembled data from 183 nations and made a series of statistical adjustments to produce a full international comparison of effective tax rates By this measurement  the US rate is considerably lower than the published rate    276 percent But in a comparative sense  thats still pretty high  Among larger international economies  only Japan  New Zealand and Thailand imposed a higher effective rate  according to the World Bank study And Japans number should fall by the time next years study comes out The World Bank also produces another    and broader    statistic This measure factors in not only the corporate profit tax but also a range of other taxes paid by businesses  including the cost of employee taxes borne by the employer When the World Bank ranked countries from the lowest level of taxes to the highest  the US ranked 124th out of 183    meaning corporate taxes were relatively high A number of other large and or democratic countries were higher  including Austria  Belgium  Brazil  China  France  Hungary  India  Italy  Spain and Sweden This last measure provides a wider snapshot of US tax policy toward businesses  but it also introduces some complications Factoring in the employer paid portion of labor taxes makes the corporate tax rate seem higher in countries that provide higher benefits such as pensions or health care through business taxes  while making the rate seem lower for countries that provide less generous benefits through the tax code So making apples to apples comparisons can be tricky Theres also broader context that Toomey doesnt get into In a previous item   we noted that when all taxes  including those such as personal income taxes and property taxes    not just corporate taxes    are taken into account and compared to gross domestic product  the US doesnt rank near the top of the OECD table in total tax burden Taking into account these complexities  we rated Toomeys comment Mostly True Obamas statement is actually more accurate than Toomeys  because he hedges a bit by saying that the United States has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world Hes right that the US does now have the highest corporate tax rates on the books  at least among the biggest industrialized democracies  which is most economists typical yardstick And US tax rates also are among the biggest by more nuanced measures,1,0,755,real

Jason Osborne tweeted   referring to the Foreign Agents Registration Act that requires Americans to disclose activities taken on behalf of foreign governments No Iranians were in the photo But people produced other photos of Iranians  reportedly in Paris An Iranian dissident named M Hanif Jazayeri identified the photographed Iranians as former Foreign Affairs Minister Kamal Kharazi and Irans Ambassador to France Abolghassem Delfi To be clear  none of the photos showed Kerry and the Iranians together The tweet followed reports about Kerrys unsuccessful 11th hour bid to preserve a deal he played an instrumental role in crafting Kerry was in Paris at the time his photo was allegedly taken  his office has told PolitiFact But his team denied any Paris meeting with Iranians took place What does this have to do with Kerry facing prison? Trump and right wing backers challenged Kerrys actions as violating the 18th century Logan Act  which prohibits unauthorized American citizens from working to undermine US foreign policy The law says that the punishment for violating the act is a fine or imprisonment of not more than three years  or both But the Conservative Stories website  which has no contact information  provided no actual evidence that Kerry was found in violation of the act and faces prison Two University of Chicago Law professors  Daniel J Hemel   and Eric A Posner   wrote in the Lawfare blog in December that there are only two known instances in which individuals have been indicted for violating the Logan Act  the last of which came in 1853  and neither indictment resulted in conviction The story said Kerry was caught blatantly commiting treason But again  the story provides no evidence beyond the photos Treason is defined in the US Constitution as consisting only in levying War against them  or in adhering to their Enemies  giving them Aid and Comfort Treason trials are rare in the US So  to recap  Whether Kerry and the Iranians met is contended As such  There is no evidence Kerry violated the Logan Act And even if he did  Nobody has been convicted of violating the Logan Act  ever,2,1,586,fake

openly advocate their political views,In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention  presidential candidate Donald Trump singled out the evangelical and religious community for their assistance in getting him nominated They have much to contribute to our politics  yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits  he said An amendment  pushed by Lyndon Johnson many years ago  threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax exempt status if they openly advocate their political views Their voice has been taken away  Trump said I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and to protect free speech for all Americans We were curious about the issue and whether an amendment   constitutional or otherwise   prevents the practice for religious institutions For this fact check  were relying largely scholarly articles in the Denver University Law Review   the Case Western Reserve Law Review   Boston College Law Review  The restriction is actually a law  not an amendment  and it isnt exclusive to religious institutions Lyndon Johnson is best known as Americas 36th president  the Texan who assumed the office when John F Kennedy was assassinated in 1963 Texas politics can be rough  and Johnson knew how to play that game Therein lies the origin of the Johnson amendment The restriction was championed by LBJ in 1954 when Johnson was a US senator running for re election A conservative nonprofit group that wanted to limit the treaty making ability of the president produced material that called for electing his primary opponent  millionaire rancher oilman Dudley Dougherty  and defeating Johnson There was no church involved Johnson  then Democratic minority leader  responded by introducing an amendment to Section 501 c  3  of the federal tax code dealing with tax exempt charitable organizations  including groups organized and operated exclusively for religious  charitable  scientific  literacy and educational purposes  or to prevent cruelty to children or animals It said  in effect  that if you want to be absolved from paying taxes  you couldnt be involved in partisan politics There was no record of any debate around the amendment The logical argument favoring such an amendment is that those corporations qualifying for the section 501 c  3  tax subsidy should not be permitted to directly or indirectly use that subsidy to support candidates for office  said Michael Hone in the Case Western article However it was likely  he said  that Johnson was motivated by a desire to exact revenge on the foundation he believed supported his opponent and to prevent it and other nonprofit corporations from acting similarly in the future Nonetheless  Subsequently it proved to have a profound effect on how thousands of tax exempt organizations   including churches   dealt with issues relating to political campaigns  according to Patrick ODaniel of the University of Texas School of Law in the Boston College article The law says all such organizations are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in  or intervening in  any political campaign on behalf of  or in opposition to  any candidate for elective public office That includes contributions to political campaigns and any form of public statement for or against a candidate or group of candidates Violating the restriction could result in the revocation of the organizations tax exempt status and the imposition of taxes Nonpartisan  unbiased voter education or similar activities such as church organized voter registration drives are allowed Historically  that hasnt stopped some religious organizations from issuing endorsements anyway ODaniel has a list of examples To cite two from 2000  Rev Jerry Falwell told worshippers at the Genoa Baptist Church in Ohio to vote for the Bush of your choice and We simply have to beat  Al  Gore That same year  a pastor at a Bronx church who supported Hillary Clintons run for the US Senate at the time  substituted her opponents name for Satan during a hymn In the face of lackluster opposition by the Internal Revenue Service  the Democrats and Republicans    continue to use the literal bully pulpits of the churches to preach to the party faithful  ODaniel wrote Nonetheless  the threat of losing tax exempt status persists as long as the law is in place  and politically minded religious groups  particularly evangelicals  have regarded it as a suppression of free speech and an entanglement of the IRS in the operation of their religion In 2008  for example  pastors in 20 states organized to give politically oriented sermons to protest the law  according to the Pew Research Center  The GOP platform has picked up that cudgel  calling for the repeal of that portion of the tax law The Johnson amendment survived court challenges in 1983  1990 and 2000  according to Pew ,0,0,771,real

President Barack Obamas administration had already given him a once over In an April 30 interview on CBS  Trump framed this detail as an inconvenient fact that the media is ignoring in order to prop up their phony storyline about Trump associates ties to Russia In fact  I just heard where General Flynn got his clearance from the Obama administration  he said And when he went to Russia  I didnt realize this  when he went to Russia  it was 2015  and he was on the Obama clearance Flynn  a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency under Obama  was ousted from his Trump administration role as national security adviser after it came to light that Flynn had lied about the nature of his conversations with the Russian ambassador Now hes the focus of a tangential controversy  complete with an investigation by the Pentagons watchdog   over payments he received from foreign governments  including Russia We were interested in Trumps statement that the Obama administration approved Flynn for security clearance  especially given that he was forced out of his Obama era role in 2014 We found that Trump has it right But that doesnt affect the main allegation against Flynn  that he didnt properly disclose payments he received from Russia  as required by law and Pentagon policy Nor does it excuse any oversights the Trump team made while considering Flynn for a White House role Flynns foreign affairs Flynn  a retired lieutenant general  spent his career as an intelligence officer in the Army  serving in both Iraq and Afghanistan and as director of intelligence for US Central Command  among other posts Obama promoted him to director of the Defense Intelligence Agency  DIA  in April 2012 Flynn retired from the agency in August 2014  news reports at the time said Flynn was forced out because he ruffled feathers with his management style Since his departure  he has said he was fired for calling our enemies radical jihadis In 2015  Flynn received more than  56 000 from three Russian entities    33 750 from state backed media outlet RT   11 250 from an air cargo company  and  11 250 from a cybersecurity firm   according to documents released by Rep Elijah Cummings  D Md  the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee In 2016  during the election  Flynns consulting firm earned more than  500 000 to work on projects that benefited the Turkish government This became public knowledge in March 2017   when the firm filed papers to the Justice Department to retroactively register as a foreign agent Several months after Flynn left the DIA in 2014  he received a letter from the agency providing guidance on what he can and cant do as an Army retiree The letter  which Flynn himself requested  says foreign compensation requires advance approval  per the Constitutions emoluments clause  Despite the letter  Flynn did not disclose to the government the payments he received from the Russian entities  according to Cummings and his Republican counterpart on the oversight committee  Rep Jason Chaffetz of Utah An April 7 letter from the DIA to Cummings and Chaffetz said the agency did not locate any records referring or relating to LTG Flynns receipt of money from a foreign source nor any records of LTG Flynn seeking permission or approval for the receipt of money from a foreign source Flynns lawyer responded   saying Flynn briefed the Defense Department on his RT speaking event But the lawyer did not specifically say whether Flynn disclosed the payments Heres how Trumps claim about Flynns security clearances fits in Retired military officials can keep their security clearances  with periodic background checks Flynns last two background checks to retain his security clearance took place during the Obama administration  in June 2010 and January 2016  according to the April 7 DIA letter Cummings and Chaffetz said Flynn didnt report his 2015 earnings from Russian entities on his 2016 application  The DIA provided Cummings and Chaffetz with portions of Flynns completed form  but the pages havent been made public  The security clearance application asks extensively about applicants foreign contacts  activities  business and travel The penalty for knowingly falsifying or concealing information on the form is a fine or up to five years in prison The evaluating agency may also deny the person a security clearance  Even if an applicant is candid about their foreign dealings  the evaluating agency could deny security clearance if it seems like those activities could compromise the applicants judgment or loyalty to the United States  said Andrew Kent  a national security expert and law professor at Fordham University White House press secretary Sean Spicer has used the fact that Flynn got through security clearance under the Obama administration to deflect blame for not properly vetting Flynn before Trump named him national security adviser Democrats  like Cummings and Obama era National Security Adviser Susan Rice   have said Spicers critique is unfair They said Flynns security clearance re evaluation was a routine process that took place several rungs below the White House  and besides  Trump is obligated to vet his advisers himself Kent said that if those evaluating Flynns 2016 application had some knowledge of his Russian activities  they might deserve some blame for not pressing Flynn for more

We wondered whether there was such an imbalance We were able to track down sources for both types of fees RK Hammer   a privately held bankcard consulting firm  tracks credit card penalty fees The firm found that card penalty fees assessed by the industry during 2010 totaled  225 billion We should note that the figure were using from RK Hammer    what the firm calls penalty fees    is an umbrella category that includes various types of fees However  the firm says that late fees    the category specifically cited by Cummings    account for more than 90 percent of penalty fees So well reduce the amount slightly  to an estimated  203 billion in late fees Meanwhile  the economic research firm Moebs Services tracks data on overdraft fees The firm projected that for 2010  overdraft fees will total  354 billion If you add these two figures  the total is  557 billion To make sure we werent double counting  we checked with both firms  and they confirmed that the two estimates do not overlap What about the agencys budget? We turned to the agencys website for the answer Budget documents posted there say that the agencys estimated budget for fiscal year 2011 is  1428 million  a number that Obama wants to increase to  329 million in fiscal year 2012 Using the 2011 figure  the agencys budget is three tenths of 1 percent of the industry fee totals Using the larger figure for 2012    which is only a proposal    it works out to six tenths of 1 percent Both figures are well under the 1 percent threshold Cummings cited And the fees in Cummings comparison are just a small slice of the resources available to financial institutions According to the Department of Commerce  profits in the finance and insurance sector for 2010    not revenues  just profits    amounted to  3668 billion  Well note here that were not ruling on whether a budget thats equal to 1 percent of penalty and overdraft fees is too little  or too much  to carry out the agencys tasks But on the specific comparison Cummings made  we found that he was accurate and even understated the disparity slightly Hes correct that the new agencys budget is only about 1 percent of the amount banks generate just from late fees and overdraft fees,2,0,585,real

Raised or lowered? raised tariffs  in an effort to collect more revenue for the federal government Did it work? Anyone? Anyone know the effects? It did not work  and the United States sank deeper into the Great Depression Steins monologue pretty much tracks with what Sasse said  The United States imposed tariffs  they backfired  and the Depression got worse Specifically  the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act of 1930   sponsored by Sen Reid Smoot  R Utah  and Rep Willis Hawley  R Ore   raised tariffs on manufactured foreign imports to 40 percent in some cases  the highest in US history It also extended tariff protection to some agricultural products It was signed on June 17  1930  or seven and a half months after Wall Streets Black Tuesday on Oct 29  1929 The Smoot Hawley tariffs  in turn  led other countries to retaliate with high tariffs of their own Several economists and historians who studied the period told us the Stein Sasse version of events is quite accurate Expert opinions Douglas Irwin  a Dartmouth College economist and author of Peddling Protectionism  Smoot Hawley and the Great Depression and Trade Policy Disaster  Lessons from the 1930s  said there was no real reason to impose the Smoot Hawley tariffs  and that it was mainly done for domestic political reasons In fact  President Herbert Hoover is said to have signed the law only reluctantly and over the spirited objections of many economists Protectionism did not cause the Great Depression  Irwin said  but he added that its fair to say it made the depression longer and more painful After the tariffs were enacted  other countries  including Canada  retaliated against the United States by establishing a preferential trade bloc with Great Britain and other countries  thus hurting US exports Other countries also used trade restrictions and protectionism as beggar thy neighbor policies to help their domestic economies during the worldwide slump  Irwin said The problem  Irwin said  was that if every country tries this strategy  everyone worse off since one countrys imports are another countrys exports World trade reduced significantly  and since trade barriers are easy to impose and hard to relax  the problem festered for some time Indeed  it took until 1933 for this downward spiral to ease Thats when President Franklin D Roosevelt    a committed opponent of the Smoot Hawley tariffs    took office As a side effect  the skirmishes over trade also frayed relations between former allies and may have contributed to the tensions that led to World War II  or at the very least complicated the Allies efforts to respond to the threat from Germany and Japan This isnt to say that there is unanimity among scholars about the precise role of Smoot Hawley in worsening the Great Depression Economists today debate the tariffs effect on the Great Depression    some feel it substantially worsened the downturn  while others think its negative effect was small  said Andrew Wender Cohen  a Syracuse University historian and author of Contraband  Smuggling and the Birth of the American Century For instance  Robert S McElvaine  a Millsaps College historian and author of The Great Depression  America 1929 1941  said the spotlighting of Smoot Hawley has been articulated most aggressively by conservative  free market advocates because it takes the focus off 1920s era tax cuts and general income inequality during that decade Still  McElvaine agreed that  even if the tariffs werent the biggest factor for prolonging the Great Depression  the tariffs did have an effect  and it was clearly negative Its also tricky to isolate causes of economic turmoil because they were tightly interwoven  experts said Its entirely possible that international trade would have dwindled even if government had not resorted to protectionism  said John E Moser  an Ashland University historian and author of Global Great Depression and the Coming of World War II However  most economists agree that protectionism at the very least did not help  and likely prolonged the Depression,12,0,885,real

But Im opposed to gay marriage Two years later  Trump hedged a bit  I think Im evolving  and I think Im a very fair person  but I have been for traditional marriage I am for traditional marriage  I am for a marriage between a man and a woman  he told MSNBC in 2013  Then Trump announced he really was running for president on June 16  2015  and he quickly reiterated he didnt support marriage equality After the US Supreme Court ruling came out on June 26  Trump tweeted   Once again the Bush appointed Supreme Court Justice John Roberts has let us down Jeb pushed him hard! Remember! Two days later  Trump told CNNs Jake Tapper on CNN that he was just for traditional marriage Trump said the next month that he thought pushing a constitutional amendment that banned same sex marriage would not be a realistic approach  But by October 2015  he began to indicate that he would seek to overturn the Obergefell vs Hodges ruling that legalized same sex marriage We have some very terrible Supreme Court justices  and frankly  they should have at least had that as a states right issue  he told CBN News  He also said he considered the ruling the law now He told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace on Jan 31  2016  that he disagreed with the courts 5 4 decision If Im elected  I would be very strong on putting certain judges on the bench that I think maybe could change things  Trump said They have ruled on it I wish that it was done by the state I dont like the way they ruled I disagree with the Supreme Court from the standpoint they should have given the state   it should be a states rights issue And thats the way it should have been ruled on  Chris  not the way they did it Looking for a concise answer  Wallace asked Trump if he would try to appoint justices to overrule the decision on same sex marriage I could strongly consider that  yes  Trump said His position didnt change during the litany of GOP primary debates  although he hasnt strongly reiterated how he wanted to appoint judges who would reverse the decision In March 2016  he said at a Detroit debate that he agreed with Texas Sen Ted Cruzs opposition to the ruling I would certainly have rather left it to the states  Trump said I was very surprised when they came up with that decision I would preferred it had been left to the states  and I think most people would have preferred that Since then  Trump has said little about same sex marriage Trumps campaign didnt respond to our request for comment  and Clintons spokesman didnt add any further comment His stump speeches tend to avoid same sex marriage  and we couldnt find any instance of a traditional media outlet directly asking him about it since the debates When the GOP unveiled its party platform during this summers Republican National Convention  which urged the reversal of the Supreme Courts redefinition of marriage  Trumps influence was downplayed Trump has not really tried to weigh in on the platform  Wyoming Sen John Barasso  the platform committee chairman  told NPR in July ,1,2,836,real

I think that its important to understand the vantage point of a senator versus the vantage point of a president  Obama replied When youre a senator  traditionally whats happened is  this is always a lousy vote Nobody likes to be tagged as having increased the debt limit for the United States by a trillion dollars As president  you start realizing  you know what  we cant play around with this stuff This is the full faith and credit of the United States And so that was just an example of a new senator making what is a political vote as opposed to doing what was important for the country And Im the first one to acknowledge it Bachmann said Obama refused to approve an increase in the debt limit when he was a senator  and that he blamed President Bush for failed leadership  as well as Bushs supporters in Congress,1,0,727,real

To get some perspective on how easy it is to get an approval rating that high  we consulted Gallups Presidential Job Approval Center which goes back to Harry Truman and lists overall favorability ratings  along with highs and lows In this context  Clintons highest numbers were relatively strong Of the dozen presidents  the six with the highest overall averages are  John Kennedy  average  701  range  56 to 83  Dwight Eisenhower  average  65 percent  range  48 to 79  George H W Bush  average  609 percent  range  29 to 89  Lyndon Johnson  average  551 percent  range  35 to 79  Bill Clinton  average  551 percent  range  37 to 73  Ronald Reagan  average  528 percent  range  35 to 68  Clinton also polls well compared to recent secretary of states  according to Gallup  Condoleezza Rices scores ranged from 59 percent to 63 percent during the George W Bush administration But neither comes close to Colin Powell  whose ratings ranged from 83 percent to 88 percent,1,0,689,real

dredged up erroneous details of a deadly naval accident to smear US Sen John McCains service record after his vote against a GOP health care bill Calling McCain a traitor and disgrace to the American People  an Aug 6  2017  post on WorldNewsCirclecom attacks the Arizona Republican for his role in a 1967 fire on the USS Forrestal during the Vietnam War Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated  as part of the social media sites efforts to combat fake news They also highlighted similar posts on some other sites  Appearing after McCain derailed GOP efforts on July 28 to pass a bill in the Senate repealing the Affordable Care Act   the article blames the then US Navy pilot for the blaze McCain train wreck career met an all time low when he was singlehandedly responsible for starting a fire on USS Forrestal Aircraft Carrier  the post read The accident claimed the lives of 134 sailors and left permanently disabled another 161 who were dismissed from active duty The essay said McCain decided to practice a reckless maneuver that day called a wet start  in which a pilot sends extra fuel to a jets thrusters to create a showy flame on takeoff The post said that wet start ignited an adjacent planes missiles  which fired and hit multiple planes filled with explosives all through the carriers deck  Still more internet posts have been saying McCain dropped his planes own bombs on the deck   causing the explosions  or that McCain abandoned the deck prematurely   This charge has been leveled against McCain before  as the event did come up during his 2008 presidential campaign  But official reports and other accounts dont support the assertion that he was responsible Fire aboard the Forrestal McCain was aboard the Forrestal as a lieutenant commander piloting an A 4 Skyhawk for the US Navy on July 29  1967  the day of the fire The Forrestal had recently been resupplied with munitions  including 1 000 pound bombs from the Korean War   stored on the deck  because modern bombs were in short supply McCains jet was parked on the deck  tail pointed outward before takeoff  as the ship sailed in the Gulf of Tonkin McCain didnt wet start his jet  but rather an F 4 Phantom about 100 feet away at the opposite end of the deck accidentally fired a rocket because of an electrical surge The details vary depending on the account  but the rocket hit either McCains plane or the plane of fellow Skyhawk pilot Lt Cdr Fred White Our friends at FactCheckorg found that McCains own statements immediately after the disaster showed him admitting his memory of the event was muddled McCain remembered the rocket hitting his own plane in Chapter 14 of his 1999 book Faith of My Fathers  In the next instant  a Zuni missile struck the belly fuel tank of my plane  tearing it open  igniting two hundred gallons of fuel that spilled onto the deck  and knocking two of my bombs to the deck But the official US Navy report of the accident said the rocket hit Whites plane  rupturing the fuel tank and igniting the jet fuel A fragment also punctured the fuel tank of another Skyhawk next to White  spilling more fuel and igniting it The rocket itself fell into the ocean without detonating  but a bomb from one of the aircraft exploded as crew members rushed to put out the flames  Subsequent reports have noted modern bombs would not have cooked off the way the Korean War era munitions did  contributing to the disaster  Gregory Freeman  author of the 2002 book Sailors to the End  has sided with McCains account  but conceded on his website that it was entirely possible the rocket hit both Skyhawks  Narrated video of the event showing the explosion is available on YouTube  McCain managed to escape his cockpit through the flames  suffering burns and shrapnel wounds in his legs and chest He described the conflagration in his book  All around me was mayhem Planes were burning More bombs cooked off Body parts  pieces of the ship  and scraps of planes were dropping onto the deck Pilots strapped in their seats ejected into the firestorm Men trapped by flames jumped overboard More Zuni missiles streaked across the deck Explosions tore craters in the flight deck  and burning fuel fell through the opening into the hangar bay  spreading the fire below McCain wrote that he helped dump some bombs over the side of the ship before heading to the ready room and then sick bay to treat his wounds He acknowledged the crew managed to control the flight deck fire by that afternoon  but below deck fires lasted for another 24 hours The fires were consuming the Forrestal I thought she might sink  he wrote But the crews heroics kept her afloat Men sacrificed their lives for one another and for their ship Many of them were only 18 or 19 years old The Forrestal was drydocked and refit  staying in service until being decommissioned in 1993  The fire  considered the worst combat related naval disaster since World War II   led to changes in crew training and flight deck procedures McCain transferred to the USS Oriskany  the aircraft carrier from which he took off on Oct 27  1967  the day he was shot down over North Vietnam and taken

The US Supreme Court  in the 2006 case Hamdan vs Rumsfeld  ruled that armed conflict not of an international character means a war that is not fought against a sovereign state  A sovereign state simply means a country with a recognized government  Since groups like ISIS are not considered sovereign states  that means that Common Article 3 applies to the current war on terrorism According to Common Article 3  people who are taking no active part in the hostilities shall in all circumstances be treated humanely To this end  the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever  violence to life and person  in particular murder of all kinds  mutilation  cruel treatment and torture Experts said this language would make Trumps approach a violation of the Geneva Conventions  assuming that the family members were not taking part in terrorist activities Common Article 3 would seem to prohibit any targeting of families or others who weretaking no active part in hostilities   said Anthony Clark Arend  Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service The principle of noncombatant immunity is a fundamental principle of international law What the Geneva Conventions say about targeting civilians This extension of the original Geneva Conventions was finalized in 1977 The most relevant portion for judging the Trump scenario appears to be Article 512  which states  The civilian population as such  as well as individual civilians  shall not be the object of attack Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited This root principle here is to ensure that civilians are not the object of an attack  said Richard D Rosen  director of the Center for Military Law and Policy at the Texas Tech University School of Law I believe that a policy of intentionally and directly targeting the families of terrorists  assuming the family members are not combatants themselves  is a gross violation of the law of war and a war crime  Rosen said Rosen and others acknowledged that there are some gray areas when putting this provision into practice For instance  the Geneva Conventions dont outlaw all civilian casualties when armed forces are undertaking a military objective It effectively permits them if precautions are taken and the expected loss of life or injury to civilians  and damage to civilian objects incidental to the attack  is not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage expected to be gained  Rosen said This balance can be difficult to strike  Ratner said  but at least it means that you cant kill a huge number of people just to knock out a small target Theres another wrinkle  Officially  the United States is not a party to the Additional Protocols of 1977 However  the United States has blessed them in practice  experts said The United States has recognized much of  the Additional Protocols  as binding customary law  said Mary Ellen OConnell  a Notre Dame law professor The Supreme Court said as much in Hamdan vs Rumsfeld in 2006 As customary international law  the US cannotpull out of the rule It binds us until a new treaty rule or customary rule supersedes it In addition  Rosen said  the Defense Department Law of War Manual published in June 2015 says that civilians may not be made the object of an attack The provisions in the Additional Protocols prohibit acts of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror in a civilian population  said David P Fidler  a law professor at Indiana University Trumps proposal to have US military forces deliberately kill families  including women and children  in order to deter ISIS fighters is a proposal to use acts of violence to spread terror among civilians Or Trump wants to fight terror with terror  something abhorrent to Americas warriors and unconscionable as a suggestion from someone who wants to be commander in chief,1,0,999,real

The issues portion of his website doesnt list abortion  but Romney wrote a June 18  2011  op ed in the conservative National Review that lays out his abortion views pretty clearly It was written after he risked alienating anti abortion activists by declining to sign a pledge offered by the Susan B Anthony List  an anti abortion group I am pro life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape  incest  or to save the life of the mother I support the reversal of Roe v Wade  because it is bad law and bad medicine Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench I support the Hyde Amendment  which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions And as president  I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood  which primarily performs abortions or offers abortion related services I will reinstate the Mexico City Policy to ensure that nongovernmental organizations that receive funding from America refrain from performing or promoting abortion services as a method of family planning  in other countries  This includes ending American funding for any United Nations or other foreign assistance program that promotes or performs abortions on women around the world I will advocate for and support a Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain from abortion And perhaps most importantly  I will only appoint judges who adhere to the Constitution and the laws as they are written  not as they want them to be written,1,0,647,real
9691,2014-07-31T11:34:58-04:00,2014,wwwnbcnewscom,Nancy Pelosi,The House of Representatives has never sued a sitting president in all of US history,The US House of Representatives recently voted to sue President Barack Obama for allegedly overstepping the powers of his office While the suit raises thorny legal questions about the limits of presidential power  its also being used by both sides to fire up their base in advance of the midterm elections The suit  spearheaded by House Speaker John Boehner  R Ohio  was approved largely along party lines  Democrats argued that its an example of the Republican majority playing politics rather than tackling urgent policy issues  such as immigration Indeed  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi  D Calif  used the looming vote to approve the suit in a recent fundraising pitch  as reported by NBC News  Boehner is planning a vote to sue the president  Pelosi wrote The House of Representatives has never sued a sitting president in all of US history And if they do it  impeachment may very well be the next step We wondered whether Pelosi is correct that the House of Representatives has never sued a sitting president in all of US history We found that shes right the House as a whole has never sued the president However  we think its worth noting that individual lawmakers and groups of lawmakers have sued the president in the past    frequently In fact  we found at least 14 instances in the last four decades alone This doesnt make Pelosis carefully worded claim inaccurate  but its worth adding important context We should note that these challenges to presidential authority generally failed  particularly challenges over whether Congress or the president has the right to initiate military action Often  the suits Achilles heel was the courts determination that the lawmakers lacked the standing    basically  a demonstrable injury    to file such a suit This succession of negative rulings for Congress has presented the plaintiffs against Obama with an uphill legal climb  analysts say  Heres a rundown of the 14 lawsuits we found    Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities vs Nixon  1974  This was one of the Watergate era cases involving what evidence President Richard Nixon had to turn over to investigators that heightened the pressure on Nixon to resign   Drummond vs Bunker  1977  William R Drummond  a citizen of the Panama Canal Zone  sued President Jimmy Carter to stop his administration from negotiating about handing over the then US held canal zone to Panama  arguing that only Congress possessed that right Six members of Congress intervened in the case alongside Drummond  arguing that the executive branch was depriving them of their constitutionally protected vote   Goldwater vs Carter  1979  Several lawmakers  led by Sen Barry Goldwater  R Ariz  sued Carter   arguing that the president had bypassed Congress by ending a defense pact with Taiwan   Crockett vs Reagan  1982  Sixteen senators and 13 House members asked a federal court to rule that the dispatching of several dozen US military personnel to El Salvador by President Ronald Reagan contradicted Congresss war powers and the Foreign Assistance Act   Sanchez Espinoza vs Reagan  1983  Twelve House members joined with 12 Nicaraguan citizens and two American citizens seeking damages and a declaration that Reagan had violated war powers restrictions by pursuing the overthrow of the Nicaraguan government   Conyers vs Reagan  1984  Eleven House members sued Reagan  arguing that his use of military force in Grenada had usurped Congresss war powers   Lowry vs Reagan  1987  Ten House members sued Reagan on war powers grounds  this time over the presidents approval of escort operations for reflagged Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf   Dellums vs Bush  1990  One senator and 53 House members sued President George HW Bush to stop him from attacking Iraq without approval from Congress during the run up to what became the Persian Gulf War   Raines vs Byrd  1997  Six members of Congress who had voted against giving the president the authority to veto individual items in bills    rather than just entire bills    sued over the acts constitutionality   Chenoweth vs Clinton  1999  Four House members sued President Bill Clinton over his creation by executive order of the American Heritage Rivers Initiative  saying it exceeded his authority as president   Campbell vs Clinton  2000  Thirty one members of Congress sued Clinton on war powers grounds for his decision to send military forces to participate in a NATO organized campaign of airstrikes in the former Yugoslavia   Kucinich vs Bush  2002  Rep Dennis Kucinich  D Ohio  sued President George W Bush over the administrations unilateral withdrawal from an anti ballistic missile treaty  arguing that the executive branch could not do that without Congress consent   Doe vs Bush  2003  Twelve House members joined with several dozen servicemembers and their families to sue Bush on war powers grounds  seeking to stop a United States led invasion of Iraq   Kucinich vs Obama  2011  Kucinich also sued Bushs successor  Obama  on war powers grounds  saying that his intervention in Libya was unconstitutional Drew Hammill  a spokesman Pelosi  said her statement is accurate because she is clearly referring to theHouse of Representatives  not individual members of Congress Kermit Roosevelt  a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania  agreed that Pelosi has some justification for singling out a lawsuit by the whole House Having a majority of the House on board suggests the grievance may be more legitimate  Roosevelt said  though he added that this scenario also suggests that the House should be able to use the powers the Constitution gives it    our familiar system of checks and balances    rather than trying to enlist the judiciary in a political struggle Still  while Pelosis claim is literally accurate  legal observers suggested that her careful wording selectively downplays a long history of clashes between the two branches of government Elizabeth Slattery  a legal fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation  agreed  saying that Pelosis statement is technically accurate  but misleading Typically  suits are brought against other executive branch officials  rather than the president directly  she said Stan Brand  a veteran Washington attorney who served as general counsel to the US House under the late Speaker Thomas P Tip ONeill  D Mass  said  It may be that the House as an institution has never sued a president  but undoubtedly there have been cases where challenges to presidential actions have occurred I am not impressed by the claim that this is the first such suit  because it elevates form over substance The much more interesting issues for me are the jurisprudential separation of powers implications of such litigation,0,0,1065,real
13260,2016-10-13T17:36:31-04:00,2016,mediumcom,Hillary Clinton,Weve had Muslims in America since George Washington,A Muslim woman at the second presidential debate asked Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton how they would help millions of Muslims in the United States deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country Trump  the Republican presidential nominee  said that Muslims have to report problems  because if they dont do that  its a very difficult situation for our country And Clinton  his Democratic rival  wont use the term radical Islamic terrorism  Trump said  which we have said is misleading  Clinton said she wanted Muslims to feel included in the country  part of our homeland security Weve had Muslims in America since George Washington  Clinton said And weve had many successful Muslims We just lost a particular well known one with Muhammad Ali We wondered about Clintons remarks about Muslims being in America since the nations first president  more than 200 years ago  There are about 275 million Muslims in America  according to estimates by Pew Research Center Islam is the second largest religion in the world after Christianity and the fastest growing Muslims were singled out this election cycle when Trump in December 2015 called for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States  until US representatives can figure out what is going on Trumps statement came a few days after a husband and wife in San Bernardino  Calif  fatally shot 14 people and wounded more than 20 others The woman was from Pakistan and on the day of the attack pledged allegiance to the Islamic State  a terrorist group also known as ISIS In June 2016  Trump said he was revising his plan  and would suspend immigration from areas with proven history of terrorism against the United States  Europe or our allies  until we fully understand how to end these threats After the mass shooting in California and other attacks in Paris   hate crimes against Muslims spiked in the United States  the New York Times reported  Given statements about banning Muslims from coming to the United States and the attacks some already in the country are facing  Clintons comment about their presence in the country dating back hundreds of years seemed relevant Muslim slaves Clintons campaign pointed us to a Feb 9  2015  opinion piece in the New York Times by Peter Manseau  who has written about American history and religions No matter how anxious people may be about Islam  the notion of a Muslim invasion of this majority Christian country has no basis in fact  Manseaus New York Times piece said  Moreover  there is an inconvenient footnote to the assertion that Islam is anti American  Muslims arrived here before the founding of the United States   not just a few  but thousands Muslims have been overlooked because they were not free to practice their faith  Manseau wrote Manseaus piece discusses a man called Estevanico who was raised in Azemmour  a Moroccan city that was once a Muslim stronghold against European invasion In 1528  an enslaved Estevanico and Spanish explorers were shipwrecked near present day Galveston  Texas Estevanico eventually escaped his Christian captors and lived in the Southwest  Manseau wrote In the 1700s  Louisiana plantation owners made it a point to add enslaved Muslims to their labor force  relying on their experience with the cultivation of indigo and rice  the New York Times piece said Arabs in America   a project at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill  also says scholars believe Estevanico was a practicing Muslim  though he nominally converted to Catholicism to appease his Spanish masters The Clinton campaign also sent over a Q A page on Toleranceorg about Muslims that says they arrived in America more than 400 years ago as slaves and that many practiced their faith in secret They also pointed to a PBS feature on Islam in America that says 10 to 15 percent of African slaves were believed to be Muslims Experts also backed up Clintons claim Kambiz GhaneaBassiri  a professor of religion and humanities at Reed College  also noted that the National Portrait Gallery includes a portrait of Yarrow Mamout   identified as an African American Muslim man and former slave His portrait reminds us that Muslims have been a part of the fabric of this nation since the beginning  Kim Sajet  director of the National Portrait Gallery  said in a July 2016 press statement when it was announced the portrait would be added as part of the museums annual rotations Scholars also referred us to a post about the Founding Fathers and Islam by James H Hutson  chief of the Manuscript Division at the Library of Congress Readers may be surprised to learn that there may have been hundreds  perhaps thousands  of Muslims in the United States in 1776   imported as slaves from areas of Africa where Islam flourished  Hutson wrote  Although there is no evidence that the Founders were aware of the religious convictions of their bondsmen  it is clear that the Founding Fathers thought about the relationship of Islam to the new nation and were prepared to make a place for it in the republic Washington said he would welcome Muslims to Mount Vernon  his home  if they weregood workmen  Hutson said Washington also suggested a way for Muslims toobtain proper relief  from a proposed bill in Virginia levying taxes to aid Christian worship  according to Hutson The post goes on to detail how the Founding Fathers in 1780 made sure the Constitution afforded the most ample liberty of conscience  to Deists  Mahometans  Jews and Christians  Hutson wrote I think that what Secretary Clinton was suggesting by her reference to George Washington was that not only have Muslims lived in the US for centuries  but that our Founding Fathers   not only George Washington but also Thomas Jefferson  Richard Henry Lee  and the men who wrote the 1780 Massachusetts Constitution   believed that Muslims should be free to practice their own religion  and they tried to guarantee this freedom and protect it in some of our Founding documents  said Jan Ellen Lewis  a history professor at Rutgers University who has contributed  700 to Clintons campaign,0,0,1011,real

The Clinton campaign told us their data comes from an analysis by the conservative Tax Foundation and the left leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities on after tax incomes of the top 1 percent We also looked at the share of tax relief received by the top 1 percent as a percentage of GDP The evidence shows Clinton is right The Bush tax cuts As a refresher  the Bush tax cuts  enacted under President George W Bush in 2001 and 2003   reduced the then top marginal tax rate of 396 percent rate to 35 percent  the 36 percent rate to 33 percent  and so forth The left leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated that the Bush cuts increased the after tax income of the top 1 percent between 53 percent and 67 percent from 2004 to 2012   tax rates for high income earners were raised the following year  Altogether  the top 1 percent received a cut equivalent to about 066 percent of GDP  the Bush tax cuts were altogether 24 percent of GDP   while the top 1 percent received 275 percent of the cuts  Trumps plan Trumps plan would increase after tax incomes of the wealthy between 102 to 199 percent  according to the Tax Foundation  and deliver a tax cut equivalent to about 132 percent of GDP Two key provisions in Trumps latest tax plan   released September 2016  are particularly relevant to this fact check First  Trump would collapse the current seven tax brackets into four  reducing the current top marginal income tax rate of 396 percent to 33 percent  His previous tax plan called for a top marginal rate of 25 percent  Second  Trump would also reduce the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent He would also apply this rate to pass through businesses  so called because their profits currently pass through the business and instead are taxed as their owners ordinary income These would include partnerships like law firms and investor groups  sole proprietorships  limited liability corporations  LLCs  and corporations with less than 100 shareholders In its analysis of Trumps tax plan  the Tax Foundation used both the 33 percent personal tax rate as well as the 15 percent pass through business rate to assess the plans impact on individual taxpayers The Tax Foundation found that  depending on which rate you apply and whether you factor in growth  the top 1 percent of taxpayers would see their after tax incomes increase by 102 to 199 percent Heres a table breaking down Trumps proposed tax cuts by income group  Similarly  the Tax Policy Center  which is affiliated with the Urban Institute  estimated that the top 1 percent would see a 135 percent gain in after tax income The think tank also said the Trumps cuts would amount to about 26 percent of GDP  with 508 percent of the cuts going to the top 1 percent In other words  the top 1 percent would see a tax break equivalent to about 132 percent of GDP Clinton may actually be understating the gains the top 1 percent would receive under Trump The Tax Foundation does not take into account one additional proposal that could affect the bottom line of many one percenters  eliminating the carried interest tax break Currently  profits from investment funds can be taxed at a personal capital gains tax rate of 239 percent rather than the top marginal income rate of 396 percent Taxing these lucrative earnings as ordinary income would raise about  18 billion over 10 years  While Trumps plan calls for closing this loophole  it could also lower the tax rate since hes proposing to tax pass through businesses at a corporate tax rate of 15 percent   an 89 percentage point reduction from the current rate applied to hedge fund and private equity profits  the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities noted ,1,0,779,real

And yet  this is not a case of inflated exuberance George Romney took the helm at American Motors in 1954 and helped rescue the company from near financial ruin He succeeded in large part on the sales of the Rambler  the first American compact car In doing so  he had to sell the concept and value of a compact car In 1958  he traveled 700 000 miles in his crusade against what he called gas guzzling dinosaurs  a reference to the large cars produced by Detroits Big Three automakers Who wants to have a gas guzzling dinosaur in his garage? he told Time magazine in 1959  for a cover article that labeled George Romney The Dinosaur Hunter He is credited with coining the term  even though other automakers cast doubts on just how economical the Rambler really was Still  the nickname  and the George Romney legend  took hold It appeared in prominent obituaries after his death July 26  1995 His youngest son  Mitt  gets it right,3,0,290,real

We decided to check it out Well begin with a brief lesson on the terms Congress uses to describe the federal budget Discretionary spending means government spending that Congress sets every year through a process known as appropriations It includes spending for most federal agencies  such as transportation and health It includes foreign aid and defense spending And it includes most grant programs administered by the federal government Non discretionary spending  on the other hand  is spending that is controlled by legislation that sets eligibility criteria or spending formulas It includes entitlement programs such as Medicare  Medicaid and Social Security in which you are legally entitled to benefits as long as you meet certain criteria It also typically includes programs for which individuals automatically qualify  such as farm subsidies or military benefits Sometimes non discretionary spending is called mandatory spending or direct spending We ran Wills comments by four experts on the federal budget They all said that Will was essentially correct  that non discretionary spending can be changed at any time by passing new legislation that changes the particular program A recent example of this is the health care law supported by President Obama and Democrats in Congress The law made many changes to Medicare  to reduce its spending  in order to offer subsidies for health care insurance to the uninsured There is no constitutional roadblock to Congress changing any spending at any time In that sense  all spending is discretionary  said Marc Goldwein  policy director for the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget The reasons members of Congress are now so focused on discretionary spending is because its more politically difficult to change programs that affect benefits for so many voters But you cant stabilize the debt by focusing on only 12 percent of the budget  Goldwein added Trying to do so is going to make the cuts far more painful than what would be necessary if we were to look more broadly Both Medicare and Social Security were on the table in previous years when the budget needed adjustment  said the experts we consulted on both sides of the political aisle Jim Horney of the left leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities noted that every major deficit reduction plan in the last 20 years has made significant changes to Medicare Brian Riedl of the conservative Heritage Foundation pointed out that Social Security was changed significantly in 1983 in a deal between Democrats in Congress and President Ronald Reagan Interest on the federal debt is a required payment unless the government is willing to default  a highly unlikely scenario There are a few other contractually obligated payments the government has to make  typically for insurance programs such as mortgage insurance  flood insurance  and federal deposit insurance But those payments are relatively small I would add that even interest on the debt is in some way discretionary  because levels of debt can be changed by decisions to tax and spend and not run budget deficits  said Josh Gordon  policy director of the Concord Coalition  a nonpartisan group that wants to eliminate deficits Will said that federal spending is all discretionary  other than interest on the national debt Social Security is discretionary We have the discretion to change the law Same is true with Medicare and Medicaid Will is making a broad statement here and leaves out a few details,1,0,681,real

Assessing the risk from Europe A report from the Henry Jackson Society   a London based group that favors a strong military to support liberal democracies  examined the number of al Qaida related incidents in the United States that had a European connection It found that since 2003  there has been only one case  that of the so called underwear bomber in 2009 The authors looked at whether perpetrators in the United States had any terrorist training Since 2005  individuals charged were less likely to have terrorist training or combat experience  less likely to be linked to al Qaida or another Designated Terrorist Organisation  and  subsequently  less likely of carrying out an attack that could lead to mass casualties  the authors wrote They concluded that the European and American counterterrorism strategy had been effective in reducing the threat of an al Qaida related attack in the United States  although the Boston Marathon bombing showed that the risk was ongoing That report came out in 2013 The security experts we reached generally echoed its findings  but they also noted that the number of Europeans who have gone to the Middle East in pursuit of jihad has climbed sharply The jihadists now have a lot of people with western passports  said Brian Jenkins  a RAND Corporation advisor and a former member of the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security It is a potential vulnerability But Jenkins also described the current methods that might catch the would be terrorist A number of security filters Jenkins walked through the example of a French citizen who went to Yemen The minute they went to Yemen  the intelligence services there are cooperative  Jenkins said Wed likely spot them on the way in and on the way out Also  the European intelligence agencies would have a chance of picking them up  and that info would be shared with us Jenkins spoke of the lists the United States maintains  beyond the no fly list of suspicious individuals He said there are other databases For many years  American security agencies have used airline data known as the Passenger Name Record It provides information on how and where a reservation was made and how it was paid for The PNR data is assessed before someone boards a plane and while they are en route I wouldnt say that there is racial or ethnic profiling here  but we have pretty good profiles of tourists and what they look like  Jenkins said If there are anomalies  that person gets looked at Should the person land in the United States  Jenkins said the track record of domestic counterterrorism has been pretty good A Saudi citizen was caught in Dallas when he tried to link up with radical Islamic sympathizers In Jenkins view  the greater risk for Americans comes from people who already live here When we look at the terror attacks in the United States since 9 11  the overwhelming number are homegrown  Jenkins said William Braniff is executive director of the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland Braniff said there are two ways to assess how effective the current strategy has been At best  it does prevent known terrorists from entering the country  Braniff said At worst  it may serve as a deterrent Attacking in Europe may be perceived as less risky but of similar reward than risking the flight to the United States Braniff cautioned  however  that the proliferation of databases and security filters comes with its own drawbacks When you get to 50 000 names  countless transliterations  and then bury them among the millions of names of air travelers coming to or from the US  implementation can become unwieldy  Braniff said Both Braniff and Jenkins noted that efforts to tighten entry rules for Europeans would have to be balanced against the strong economic benefits of tourism and business that the current system allows,1,0,962,real

No I mean  its a serious question A reader wrote to us to ask whether OReilly did ask that question of Bush So we looked into it We discovered that OReilly was referring to an interview aired on Nov 11  2010   when Bush  by then out of office for almost two years  was doing publicity for his memoir  Decision Points  Heres the exchange between OReilly and Bush  OREILLY  Okay But  the people in the press hated you  a lot of them Why? Why? BUSH   I dont know You have to ask them Im not a hater  and so sometimes its hard for me to understand why somebody hates somebody It could have been because of my policies  maybe they didnt like my religion I dont know Im sure theres a myriad of reasons Thats what happens when youre the president It can either bother you or not bother you I chose    OREILLY  You ever think about it? BUSH  Being hated? No  not really OREILLY  Really? Never? BUSH  No Im a pretty comfortable guy right now  you know OREILLY  You look it BUSH  I really am Im honored to have served Im glad I served  and I gave it my all  and thats all you can do at life I got back    and this sounds corny to some  I understand  but when I looked in the mirror  I know I didnt sell my soul for the sake of any short term politics or popularity I think thats important For the record  heres how Obama answered OReilly  You know  the truth is  that the people    and Im sure previous presidents would say the same thing  whether it was Bush or Clinton or Reagan or anybody The people who dislike you dont know you  What they hate is whatever funhouse mirror image of you thats out there  I think that by the time you get here  you have to have had a pretty thick skin If you didnt  then you probably wouldnt have gotten here Technically  OReilly asked slightly different questions of each president To Obama  he asked whether it disturbs him to be hated by so many Americans To Bush  he asked how he felt about being hated by a lot of people in the press  and then followed up by asking him more generally if he ever thought about being hated Still  OReillys two lines of inquiry are similar enough that were giving OReilly a True,7,0,475,real

Are they making a sacrifice? In an interview with Foxs Sean Hannity on Feb 22  2011  Republican Jeff Fitzgerald  speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly  said Wisconsin legislators would be subject to the same cuts the governor is proposing for other government workers You know  we are all in this together  Fitzgerald said Every legislator that votes for this bill as well is going to do the same for themselves We have to give up the same amount of pay Amid the fiery debate over benefits cuts and collective bargaining rights    and the potential ripple effect around the nation    we havent heard much about how Walkers plan would personally affect the legislators who will vote on it  so we decided to check Fitzgeralds comment Walkers plan would require most public workers to pay half their pension costs    typically 58 percent of pay for state workers    and at least 12 percent of their health care costs A detailed analysis of Walkers proposal by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau says that under Walkers plan any participant in the Wisconsin Retirement System  including elected officials  would be required to make an employee contribution to the WRS in an amount equal to one half of all actuarially required contributions  as approved by the Employee Trust Fund  ETF  Board Under current 2011 rates  one half of the general participant rate would be 58 percent and one half of the executive elected official rate would be 665 percent So elected officials would actually be paying a little more than government workers  said Robert Lang  director of the Wisconsins Legislative Fiscal Bureau Currently  Lang noted  most general government employees pay a slight share    less than 1 percent of their salary    toward their pension  and elected officials dont pay anything As for health benefits  the bill doesnt specifically mention the effect on elected officials It simply talks about changes related to anyone participating in the states group insurance board coverage That includes elected officials  Lang said So elected officials also would have to pay the same share for health care as all state employees covered by the health plan  For details  see pages 29 and 30 of the Legislative Fiscal Bureau analysis   Theres one other piece of the bill that would affect the benefits of elected officials  and it has to do with the way pension benefits are calculated Pension payments are based on a formula derived from the employees salary  years of service and a set multiplier For general employees  that multiplier is 16 For elected officials  the multiplier is currently 20 Under the budget repair bill  however  the multiplier for elected officials would drop to 16  the same as everyone else  see page 3 of the budget repair bill  or page 33 of the Fiscal Bureau analysis for further details  Bottom line  theyll be getting less in their pension checks The new  lower multiplier wont take effect until the next legislative session We also ran Fitzgeralds statement by Jeff Leverich  senior researcher for the Wisconsin Education Association Council  and he agreed with Lang That is our understanding too  co pay applies to elected officials  however  some ambiguity remains about when they might be enacted given statutory language governing timing of compensation changes for  elected officials  Leverich stated via e mail According to Lang  elected officials would have to start paying more toward pension and health benefits immediately  just like everyone else Leverich  of WEAC  also argued that while co pays may be the same for elected officials  there would still be a disparity in bargaining positions Please realize  however  that the elimination of bargaining rights is a different order of magnitude  Leverich said The effects of the legislation on the two parties  legislators public workers  is truly dissimilar In short  Fitzgerald said the legislators who will vote on Walkers bill would have to give up the same amount of pay Aside from the collective bargaining issues  Walkers plan would make state employees pay more for health and pension benefits And according to the bill  elected officials would take the same hits,2,0,716,real

The 25th Amendment  added to the Constitution in 1967  sought to resolve several thorny issues of presidential and vice presidential power It creates a succession plan for when these top two positions go vacant It also allows the president to declare himself unable to fulfill his duties and transfer power to the vice president However  were mostly interested in the 25th Amendments fourth and final section  which allows someone other than the president to make a finding of presidential disability Section four authorizes the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet  or another body as determined by lawmakers  to declare a president unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office Doing so would then elevate the vice president to the position of acting president The president can restore his powers by declaring that no inability exists However  the same body that initially transferred power to the vice president can respond by essentially doubling down on their declaration that the president is unable to discharge his duties Then  if Congress  by a two thirds vote in both the House and Senate  agrees that the president is unable to serve  the vice president continues to act as president Such a move could permanently strip a president of his powers   hence  why some legal analysts refer to section four as the  involuntary removal mechanism  What did the authors intend? The push for Congress to formalize a blueprint for handling presidential disability gained traction after President John F Kennedys assassination on Nov 22  1963  though lawmakers had first considered it much earlier in American history  The assassination of President Kennedy  produced a flurry of additional proposals dealing with the subject  John D Feerick wrote in a 1995 article in the Wake Forest Law Review These proposals were influenced by the sense at that time that  if Kennedy had lived  the country would have had to deal with the problem of presidential inability in a most tragic setting As congressional hearings unfolded  little controversy surrounded the amendments first three sections  according to Feerick Perhaps unsurprisingly  the real debate centered on when someone other than the president could declare him or her to be incapacitated The amendments principal author  Sen Birch Bayh  D Ind  embraced an understanding that presidential inability would encompass both physical and mental inability  said Joel Goldstein  a law professor at St Louis University  whos closely studied the congressional record The formulation he adopted was put forth by Sen Robert F Kennedy  D NY  who said presidential inability involves physical or mental inability to make or communicate his decision regarding his capacity and physical or mental inability to exercise the powers and duties of his office Another important architect of the amendment  Rep Richard Poff  R Va  held a similar view  according to Goldstein Poff said section four not only applied when the president  due to accident or illness  was unconscious or otherwise unable to make or communicate a decision  but also when the President  by reason of mental debility  is unable or unwilling to make any rational decision  including particularly the decision to stand aside On July 6  1965  Congress formally proposed the 25th Amendment  and the necessary 38 states ratified it Feb 10  1967 Legal experts told us the drafters used intentionally vague and open ended language  ie  a president who is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office  because they recognized they couldnt predict every scenario in which a president could be deemed disabled But despite the definitions fuzziness  Goldstein said the record makes clear that section four was not intended as a means of removing the president simply because he or she makes an unpopular decision So did Schiffs claim that the authors intended to cover physical incapacitation  serious mental illness and a general an inability to function  hit the mark? I think hes right  as far as a one sentence summary could have it  said Brian Kalt  a law professor at Michigan State University They made the process and the terms flexible  but that was what they were mainly thinking of,3,0,885,real

that said former FBI director James Comey was covering up the source of leaked Democratic National Committee emails for Hillary Clinton is based on a single source that has admitted he had no evidence The headline on a May 16  2017  post on PatriotCriercom read  Bombshell  Comey knew murdered DNC staffer  Seth Rich  was WikiLeaks source   covered it up for Hillary Facebook users flagged the story in an effort to identify potential fake news The post is based on a persistent and unfounded conspiracy theory about how the website WikiLeaks came by thousands of internal DNC emails during last years presidential election Seth Richs death Seth Rich was a 27 year old voter access projects staffer for the DNC who was shot and killed near his Washington home on July 10  2016 The case is still unsolved  but Washington police said it was probably a botched robbery WikiLeaks published thousands of emails a few days after Richs death Some conspiracy theorists have concluded that Rich must have been the one who leaked the emails  and was killed to scare other potential leakers WikiLeaks offered  20 000 for more information about Richs death  drawing some attention to the scenario WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has never said Rich was the source On May 15  Rod Wheeler  a private investigator hired by Richs family  claimed he could prove Rich was indeed the source of the leak He told Washington area Fox affiliate WTTG that sources in the FBI said they had evidence proving it The next day  Fox News reported an anonymous federal investigator backed up what Wheeler was saying This official said the FBI had determined Rich had been in contact with WikiLeaks  sending them more than 40 000 DNC emails Most of the PatriotCriercom conspiracy theory is based on this unfounded insistence that the FBI has proof of this connection Its apparent that Wheeler was being guarded in giving his statement  but the fact is the FBI has been in possession of Richs laptop and the agencys director at the time  James Comey  locked down the contents to protect either certain people at the DNC  or members of Hillarys campaign team  or Hillary Clinton  or likely all three  the PatriotCriercom post read There is no contact information on PatriotCriercom  and we did not receive a response when we contacted the site through an affiliated Facebook page  The sites registration information is hidden  Its quite a stretch to pin on an anonymous federal investigator that Comey examined the evidence  drew a conclusion that proved Rich was the WikiLeaks source and then hid it specifically to protect Clinton Wheeler didnt even mention the former FBI director  and we didnt find any evidence of Comey commenting on Richs death The entire conspiracy theory had been under the radar  confined to corners of the Internet  until Wheelers story emerged  by which time Comey had been fired by President Donald Trump But the more egregious problem with the PatriotCriercom post is that it didnt include what happened next  Wheeler admitted to CNN on March 16 that he had actually gotten the information from the Fox News reporter to whom he had discussed the issue The Rich family sent Wheeler a cease and desist letter   saying their son was not WikiLeaks  source They also demanded retractions from Fox for reporting the story Fox News eventually retracted its story and removed it from FoxNewscom WTTG posted a follow up to its story   saying Wheeler had backtracked on what he described as a miscommunication The FBI has not officially acknowledged conducting an investigation   a WhiteHousegov petition demanding Comey get involved was created in January 2017  but has so far only garnered about 1 000 signatures  Some media outlets have reported that anonymous FBI and law enforcement officials confirmed the agency is not investigating Richs death  and that Washington police never gave them Richs laptop and therefore the agency hadnt examined its contents An FBI spokeswoman confirmed only that Richs death was being investigated by the Metropolitan Police Department What the FBI did do is alert the DNC of a data breach prior to the WikiLeaks release  and subsequently connected the breach to hackers with Russian ties  The only other source even remotely supporting the idea Rich was involved is a hacker living in New Zealand named Kim Dotcom He said someone going by the name of Panda had contacted him in 2014 to get help starting a political group in the United States Dotcom said he is certain Panda was actually Rich  and knows that Rich was the WikiLeaks source He has not shown any proof Dotcom is currently facing extradition to the United States on a host of conspiracy and racketeering charges levied by the Justice Department Richs family

11021,2015-07-02T11:06:44-04:00,2015,wwwamsusdagov,Facebook posts,The House of Representatives just voted 300 131 to removecountry of origin labeling on chicken  pork  and beef sold in the US,Thanks to a little known congressional bill  it may soon be impossible to tell whether your Fourth of July burger is all American Angus or beef imported from the Amazon  according to a Facebook meme The House of Representatives just voted 300 131 to removecountry of origin labeling on chicken  pork  and beef sold in the United States  the meme says  Sorry but you dont deserve to know where your meat is coming from What beef could the House possibly have with the consumer friendly law? We looked into the vote in question and found an interesting story of international trade disputes  riled up Canadian hog farmers  and jingoist fears Meat of the matter Under the country of origin labeling law  or COOL   supermarkets have to tell consumers where their meat  fish  and nuts are produced with varying degrees of specificity  ie Born in Canada  Slaughtered in the US  Farm Raised in Vietnam  or simply a laundry list of all the countries the product has passed through  COOL passed in 2002 but wasnt fully implemented until March 2009 By then  Canada already had a bone to pick with the law  saying it violated World Trade Organization agreements A mandatory made in stamp discriminated against foreign hog farmers and cattle ranchers and was too costly to boot  according to Canada Joining Canadas complaint were a long list of other countries Between 2011 and 2015  the WTO ruled four times that COOL was inconsistent with trade agreements The United States made several unsuccessful appeals  but eventually Canada and Mexico asked the WTO for permission to impose retaliatory tariffs totalling  3 billion The WTOs decision is pending In May of 2015  House Agriculture Committee Chair K Michael Conaway  R Texas  introduced HR 2393   a bill to repeal the labeling requirements for ground and muscle cuts of beef and pork    and threw in chicken for good measure Retaliation by Canada and Mexico will soon become a reality  meaning economically devastating tariffs on a broad spectrum of US exports  Conaway wrote in Roll Call Ripple effects will be felt in nearly every industry  every state and every consumers wallet This is why COOL for beef  pork and chicken   nothing more than a failed government experiment   must be repealed On June 10  the House passed the repeal bill by a not entirely partisan vote of 300 131   a third of House Democrats voted in favor of the Republican backed bill Saving COOLs bacon The memes wording implies that the country of origin labeling laws fate is sealed  but thats a bit hammed up The bill now awaits the Senates and  ultimately  President Barack Obamas approval In the upper chamber  COOL repeal will be more of a battle The politics are going to be much  much more difficult in the Senate  said Victoria Guida  a trade reporter for Politico Part of the reason this passed the House so easily is because so many other industries  outside of the meat world  are freaked out about retaliation But the Senate tends to be a little more big picture about policies  and straight repeal is expected to have a tough time The Senate Agricultural Committee held hearings on June 25  where Chairman Pat Roberts  R Kan  called for repeal In lieu of completely getting rid of the labeling law  top Democrat  Sen Debbie Stabenow of Michigan  proposed a voluntary labeling system supported by some Republicans but rejected by Conaway  We didnt hear back from the White House about what the president plans to do if the bill reaches his desk If the repeal is greenlit by both the Senate and the White House  country of origin still wont be prohibited from meat packaging As per Stabenows proposal  it could potentially mirror the USDAs paid grading service of beef  ie prime choice and select   though supporters say thats not enough The  meat  industry has had plenty of time to do a COOL program  and they didnt So we have mandatory COOL That is the solution that provides consumers with what theyre demanding  Chris Waldrop of the Consumer Federation of America Whats at steak At its core  COOL is a consumer rights law  intended to help people make purchasing decisions    be it supporting American ranchers or boycotting beef associated with Amazon deforestation Yet it has provoked intense debate While 90 percent of Americans want country of origin labeling  the interest doesnt necessarily reflect in the dollars spent  says Jayson Lusk  an agricultural economist at Oklahoma State University Analysis of scanner data from grocery stores shows essentially no impact of  mandatory country of origin labeling  when buying meat  he said Despite this  there are real and demonstrable costs to processors and retailers Thus  the totality of evidence suggests that COOL does not pass a cost benefit test Canada and Mexico have also argued that the labeling might make people think US products are safer  even when experts say there is little evidence to support or refute that point US companies have been doing a marvelous job of poisoning us for years  said Bill Marler  a food borne illness attorney and publisher of Food Safety News He pointed out that Malaysia banned American apples earlier this year due to a listeria outbreak  and Mexico rejected Californian lettuce in 2006 after growers found E coli on the crop While Marler thinks COOL can feed jingoist fears  he nonetheless supports it  as he believes in greater transparency in the food system Like Marler  283 consumer  agricultural  environmental  labor  and faith based groups say COOL is about empowering consumers In a letter ultimately unheeded by Conaway  they urged the House to not bow to the standard scare tactics of trade partners We shouldnt automatically repeal a law passed by Congress because an international trade tribunal tells us it violates trade law We first need to look at other options aside from repeal  said Ben Lilliston of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy  a sustainable farming advocacy group He added that COOL laws exist around the world   and United States has willingly paid tariffs when its disagreed with past WTO rulings Consumers have a legitimate interest in knowing where their food comes from  said Waldrop of the Consumer Federation of America,1,0,1034,real
7182,2012-12-17T12:24:22-05:00,2012,westcongressnewsletternet,Allen West,This week the House of Representatives voted to remove the wordlunatic from federal law,The first week of December in Congress was dominated by news about the fiscal cliff So you will forgive us if we overlooked this other tidbit tucked into the final weekly newsletter sent by US Rep Allen West  R Palm Beach Gardens This week we voted in the House of Representatives to remove the wordlunatic from federal law  wrote West  who lost a close race to Democrat Patrick Murphy in District 18 in Floridas Treasure Coast However  that does not mean there isnt plenty of lunacy going on in the workings of the federal government! We cant fact check the amount of lunacy in Washington  DC  but we couldnt resist looking into whether the House actually voted to remove the word lunatic from federal law On Dec 5  the House voted 398 1 in favor of Senate Bill 2367   the 21st Century Language Act of 2012 The bill  which the Senate approved by unanimous consent in May  struck the word lunatic from federal law As of Dec 17  it was awaiting President Barack Obamas signature The vote was part of an effort to remove outdated and demeaning language  and it was supported by advocates for people with mental health conditions The bill was sponsored by Sen Kent Conrad  D ND  in response to a constituents request The termlunatic derives from the Latin word formoon   said Rep Lamar Smith  R Texas  before the House vote  according to the congressional record Before the modern era  it was used to describe a person who suffers from mental disease because of the belief that lunar cycles had an impact on brain function But as science and medicine have progressed  society has come to understand mental illness with more clarity Rep Robert C Scott  D Va  said this bill eliminates outdated references in the US Code that stigmatize individuals with mental illness issues  The termlunatic holds a place in antiquity and should no longer have a prominent place in our US Code Scott compared it to a law in 2010 that replaced parts of federal law containing the phrase having mental retardation with the phrase having intellectual disabilities The bill deletes lunatic from Section 1 of Title 1 of the US Code which states the wordsinsane andinsane person andlunatic shall include every idiot  lunatic  insane person  and person non compos mentis The Congressional Research Service summary says the bill removes references to the wordlunatic from rules of construction of the US Code and banking law provisions concerning   1  trust powers of banks  and  2  bank consolidations and mergers University of Miami banking law professor Stanley Langbein told PolitiFact Florida that  By lunatics  the law means what today we would refer to as personsadjudicated incompetent   and the persons affairs would probably not be administered by a committee  but by what we would call aguardian   Moreover  the termlunatic  though once commonly used in the law  the late 19th and early 20th centuries  is no longer used  when it was used  I believe it referred to a mentally disabled individual  usually what we would call aspecial needs person  or more harshly amentally retarded person  today The lone no vote was cast by Rep Louie Gohmert  R Texas  who issued a statement saying  Not only should we not eliminate the word lunatic from federal law when the most pressing issue of the day is saving our country from bankruptcy  we should use the word to describe the people who want to continue with business as usual in Washington For the record  West voted to strike the word lunatic  but he only gave it a brief mention in his final weekly newsletter  which focused more on the anniversary of Pearl Harbor  foreign affairs  and the economy And West wrote that his final weekly update as a congressman from District 22 wasnt really his last word  He represented District 22 but ran in District 18 due to redistricting For more on his parting thoughts  read his post election interview with NPR  ,0,1,660,real
2592,2010-10-14T18:04:10-04:00,2010,latimesblogslatimescom,Chris  Coons,New Castle Countys unemployment rate has not almost doubled in the last two years,In the Sept 13  2010  Delaware Senate debate between Democrat Chris Coons and Republican Christine ODonnell  the candidates split in he said  she said fashion over an unemployment statistic ODonnell kicked it off by charging that unemployment here in New Castle County rose  almost doubled in the last two years under  Coons  watch as New Castle County executive A moment later  Coons countered  I also frankly cant imagine where she found the numbers that unemployment doubled in just the past year under my watch I suspect were going to need to keep a close eye this evening on the numbers that go flying back and forth One of the moderators  CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer  interjected  Lets ask her Where did you get those numbers? ODonnell responded  The Department of Labor statistics And well have them on our web site by tomorrow Sounds like a dispute tailor made for PolitiFact  How much did unemployment rise in New Castle County  the most populous of Delawares three counties? Lets first clarify a few matters In Coons reply  he misstated the time frame ODonnell had used  saying it was one year when in fact she had said she was looking at the past two years Well analyze the question using ODonnells criteria    two years    while noting that Coons garbled ODonnells time frame We also wont get into the question of whether a county executive deserves direct blame for rising unemployment  even though one can argue that unemployment is more sensitive to national and international economic factors than local ones For our answer  we turned to the Local Area Unemployment Statistics database at the Bureau of Labor Statistics  a division of the US Labor Department In the most recent available month  August 2010  New Castle County  Del  registered an 87 percent unemployment rate Two years before  in August 2008  the rate was 55 percent  The figures are not seasonally adjusted  but since were comparing August of one year to August of another  making seasonal adjustments should be irrelevant in this comparison  Thats a difference of 33 percentage points  or an increase of 58 percent over the August 2008 unemployment rate of 55 percent If the rate had doubled as ODonnell said  it would have needed to increase by 100 percent  which would have brought the unemployment rate to 11 percent today And it clearly isnt that high ODonnell did give herself some breathing room by saying that the rate almost doubled over the past two years But while its possible to argue that 58 percent should be rounded up to 100 percent  or double   we think thats a stretch After wed finished our research  we received a response from the ODonnell campaign A spokesman said that ODonnell was actually referring to the rise in unemployment starting at the beginning of Coons tenure as county executive We confirmed with the New Castle County government that Coons  who was elected in November 2004  was inaugurated in January 2005 So we looked at the county unemployment rate for January 2005 and found that it was 47 percent That did rate roughly double by August 2010    but thats a period of five and a half years  not two  as ODonnell had said in the debate Using that time frame also measures unemployment from a point well before the economy slid into recession to a point of stubbornly high unemployment rates everywhere  so it would hardly be surprising to find the numbers rise As it happened  New Castle County performed better than the nation as a whole at each of these three points in time The countys 47 percent unemployment rate in January 2005 was lower than the national 53 percent rate that month The 55 percent unemployment rate in August 2008 was lower than the national rate of 62 percent that month  and the countys 87 percent in August 2010 was lower than the national rate of 96 percent In fact  unemployment grew slightly more slowly in New Castle County over that period than it did nationally So where does this leave us? While ODonnell is correct that unemployment has risen in New Castle County  as it has everywhere  the increase wasnt almost double over two years    the period she said during the debate By saying that she meant to measure it from the beginning of Coons term as county executive  her campaign team is essentially conceding that she got the fact wrong In our role as debate referee  we give Coons stance that ODonnell erred a rating of True,3,0,751,real
15133,2018-03-14T10:37:41-04:00,2018,wwwc,Donald Trump,Says China and Singapore impose the death penalty on drug dealers,President Donald Trump floated the idea of imposing the death penalty on drug dealers in the United States during his Pennsylvania rally  saying China and Singapore do it and they dont have a drug problem The only way to solve the drug problem is through toughness  Trump said March 10 while stumping for Republican congressional candidate Rick Saccone When you catch a drug dealer  you got to put him away for a long time Trump shared conversations he had with leaders of China and Singapore When I was in China and other places  by the way  I said  Mr President  do you have a drug problem?No  no  no  we do not I said  Huh Big country  14 billion people  right Not much of a drug problem I said what do you attribute that to?Well  the death penalty On Singapore  I said  Mr President  what happens with your drugs?No We dont have a problem  President I said  really why?We have a zero tolerance And he is not playing games  So what do you mean no problem?We have a zero tolerance policy What does that mean?That means if we catch a drug dealer  death penalty  PolitiFact decided to fact check whether China and Singapore have the death penalty for drug dealers as Trump claimed  We will set aside for now whether these countries have no drug problems as a result  as Trump claimed the leaders said  We found those countries do have the death penalty for individuals who traffic  smuggle or transport certain drugs The White House did not comment on the record  but in the context of Trumps speech  it appears these are the individuals he was referring to when speaking about drug dealers   not just individuals who may sell drugs on the streets Nonetheless  China and Singapore have also been called out as human rights abusers for these practices  and drug policy and law experts expressed skepticism about the death penalty being a deterrent for drug trafficking in the United States Chinas laws Chinese law says that individuals who smuggle  traffic  transport or manufacture drugs and meet certain conditions are to be punished with 15 years of fixed term imprisonment  life imprisonment or death sentence  and confiscation of their properties The law mentions certain amounts of opium  heroin  methylaniline and other narcotic drugs of large quantities Human rights groups and experts say data on death sentences and executions in China is unreliable and unknown That information is kept as a state secret  Amnesty International estimates thousands of people are executed and sentenced to death each year Given data limitations  its difficult to assess the efficacy of its policy against drug offenders Singapores law Singapores Misuse of Drugs Act calls for the death penalty for individuals convicted of trafficking specified amounts of opium  cocaine  cannabis  and other substances The law said the word traffic means to sell  give  administer  transport  send  deliver or distribute Individuals possessing certain amounts of specified drugs are also presumed to have it for the purpose of trafficking  unless proven otherwise Recent law revisions give courts discretion not to impose the death penalty in certain circumstances A March 2010 study on executions  deterrence and homicide in Hong Kong and Singapore said there are no decent indicators available regarding drug use over time in Singapore  and if the data exists  they are a government secret Singapores minister for foreign affairs  Vivian Balakrishnan  at a September 2016 United Nations meeting said his country regarded drug trafficking as a most serious crime  and that the death penalty kept major drug syndicates away from Singapore Singapore had eight executions for drugs from 2015 to 2017  according to a March 2018 report from Harm Reduction International American application Drug policy and law experts said attempts at similar laws in the United States would face constitutional obstacles They pointed to a high bar for the death penalty established in the 2008 US Supreme Court case Kennedy vs Louisiana  which addressed whether states violate the Eighth Amendments ban on cruel and unusual punishment by imposing the death sentence for the crime of child rape The courts opinion said the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victims life was not taken However  the court said its concern was limited to crimes against individual persons and did not address offenses against the State  such as treason  espionage  terrorism  and drug kingpin activity Congress in 1994 enacted a law allowing the imposition of the death penalty for drug kingpins even if no death occurred  If the death penalty is unconstitutional to impose against a child rapist  it is hard to imagine a court upholding its imposition against a person for selling drugs  said Alex Kreit  a law professor and co director of the Center for Criminal Law and Policy at Thomas Jefferson School of Law Experts also questioned how effective the death penalty would be as a deterrent for drug offenders The likelihood of getting caught  prosecuted  convicted  and sentenced to death   especially at the federal level with only three executions since 1964   is tiny  said Matthew Robinson  a professor of criminal justice at Appalachian State University,6,0,854,real

Obama replied that he often discusses the connection between Wall Street and Main Street We need a vibrant  vital financial sector that is investing in businesses  investing in jobs  investing in our people  providing consumers loans so they can buy products    all that is very important and we want that to thrive But weve got to do so in a responsible way  he said Now  I had been amused over the last couple years    this sense of somehow me beating up on Wall Street    I think most folks on Main Street feel like they got beat up on  Obama said Theres a big chunk of the country that thinks that I have been too soft on Wall Street  he added Thats probably the majority  not the minority  We should note that Obama was interrupted by applause during these comments Weve noticed that some of Obamas political opponents repeatedly say he is anti business  so we were intrigued by Obamas comment that theres a big chunk of the country that thinks that I have been too soft on Wall Street So we went out in search of data Interestingly  we couldnt find a poll that directly and specifically asked the public whether President Obama had been too soft or too tough on Wall Street But we did find one poll that was pretty close A poll conducted in May 2010 by CBS News asked  Do you think the financial institutions on Wall Street have too much influence  too little influence  or the right amount of influence on the Obama Administration? Too much  said a resounding majority of 59 percent After that  21 percent said they were unsure  while 12 percent said the right amount and 5 percent said too little We also found that most Americans favor new financial regulations that Obama signed into law in July A USA Today Gallup poll conducted in August showed 61 percent approved of the legislation   the highest of any of Obamas legislative accomplishments Finally  its worth mentioning Gallups poll from July that asked the public about its confidence in various institutions  Gallup asked which institutions merited a great deal or quite a lot of confidence The presidency garnered 36 percent confidence  while banks got 23 percent and big business got 19 percent  Congress did the worst  with 11 percent  But polls can be contradictory  particularly when questions are asked in a different way So we looked for data that would undermine Obamas claim We found one poll that indicated people might be more conflicted about government being tough on Wall Street A poll from May asked people which of two scenarios they feared more  that the government will go too far in regulating financial institutions and markets  making it harder for the economy to grow  OR  that the government will not go far enough in regulating financial institutions and markets  leaving the country at risk of another financial crisis? Respondents split fairly evenly in this poll from Pew Research and the National Journal  46 percent worried the government would go too far with financial regulation  while 44 percent worried government wouldnt go far enough Another 11 percent were unsure  and the margin of error was 4 percent But even that fits with Obamas statement that theres a big chunk of the country that thinks that I have been too soft on Wall Street Obama added  Thats probably the majority  not the minority  but his use of the word probably indicates hes unsure Here  were checking Obamas statement that theres a big chunk of the country that thinks that I have been too soft on Wall Street We didnt find a lot of polling data on this question The question that addresses it most closely was whether the financial institutions on Wall Street have too much influence  too little influence  or the right amount of influence on the Obama Administration The resounding answer to that was yes  they have too much influence,3,0,777,real

For this item  well focus on this part of the ad   And Palin even encouraged the cruelty by proposing a  150 bounty for the severed foreleg of each killed wolf   The cruelty  in question was a state sanctioned hunt intended to thin out the wolf population Indeed  Palins administration announced the  150 bounty for the  left forelegs of wolves  as part of a larger effort to reduce wolf populations in five areas of the state  according to a press release from the Alaska Department of Fish   Game dated March 21  2007 The payments are made to volunteer pilots and shooters who are permitted to track and kill predators in the winter months State biologists planned to use the forelegs as specimens to study the wolf population Department spokesman Tim Barry said the idea came from state biologists and Palins office played a key role in developing the cash incentive program Proposals of this nature ultimately are approved by the states Board of Game  which is appointed by the governors office The release contends the payment isnt a  bounty   but thats a matter of semantics An Alaskan judge who later declared the payments illegal called it a  bounty  pure and simple  in his ruling In fact  the Defenders of Wildlife Action  which made this ad  was among the conservation groups that took Alaska to court over the incentive program Whats missing from the campaign ad is the context about wildlife management in Alaska  and the history of the program Unlike other areas where wolves are protected  Alaska officials estimate the states vast wilderness holds 7 000 to 11 000 wolves These elusive predators hunt moose and caribou  which are favorite targets for hunters seeking food and sport in Alaska In 2003  then Gov Frank Murkowski initiated the program to manage the wolf population In 2007  the state wanted to kill between 382 and 664 wolves  but the nearly 200 permitted hunters had shot only about 100 wolves as the hunting season neared its April 30 end High fuel prices and limited snowfall made it hard to track the animals  so Palins administration offered the  150 per wolf as an extra incentive  to motivate permittees to redouble their efforts and to help offset the high cost of aviation fuel   the release states The organization behind the ad  along with other environmental groups  filed a lawsuit to stop the payments because wildlife bounties were outlawed in 1984 About 40 wolves were killed after the bounty was offered  but the payments were never made to hunters The judge struck down the incentive program 10 days after it was announced  Barry said The advertisement is intended to shock viewers by presenting Palin without the context of political life in frontier Alaska  where wildlife management is a high profile government function But the facts are right and the missing context has more to do with sensibilities than factual accuracy,1,0,626,real

11770,2016-01-17T22:39:48-05:00,2016,berniesanderscom,Hillary Clinton,Says Bernie Sanders has reversed his position on immunity for gun manufacturers and sellers,In the increasingly competitive Democratic primary for president  former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has spent months hammering Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders for his vote on a 2005 bill that provided gun makers  sellers and trade associations with significant protection against lawsuits Now  after Sanders clarified his position on the issue  shes calling him a flip flopper Sanders  who represents the small  rural state of Vermont where guns are widely accepted  has sometimes sided with advocates of gun rights on key legislation and sometimes sided with supporters of gun control One of the primary examples where Sanders broke with Democrats is in supporting the gun liability bill  which was enacted in 2005  A similar bill also passed the US House in 2003  Sanders  then serving in the House  voted for it both times Clinton called on Sanders to stand up and say I got this one wrong in a Jan 8 interview on MSNBCs Hardball About a week later  Sanders released a statement on the gun liability issue in the run up to the Jan 17 Democratic debate in Charleston  SC In a news release   Sanders said  Im pleased that this legislation is being introduced  referring to proposals by Sen Richard Blumenthal  D Conn  and Rep Adam Schiff  D Calif  to rescind portions of the 2005 law As I have said for many months now  we need to look at the underlying law and tighten it up  Sanders added The Clinton camp portrayed this as a flip flop during the Charleston debate Clinton said  I am pleased to hear that Sen Sanders has reversed his position on immunity  and I look forward to him joining with those members of Congress who have already introduced legislation The Sanders camp disagreed that this was a change of position Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver had told MSNBC  This is not a flip flop  this is consistent with the position he held earlier in the campaign So is Clintons portrayal accurate? We took a closer look Sanders vote on the 2005 bill While the bill includes two relatively non controversial provisions    one on trigger locks and the other on armor piercing bullets    the most contentious elements of the 2005 bill  and the ones that drove overwhelming Democratic opposition at the time  deal with liability for gun makers and sellers The official bill summary provides for broad based immunity for gun sellers  but it also provides a few exceptions  such as    Cases where a person transfers a firearm knowing that a violent crime or drug trafficking crime will be committed with it    Cases where a seller is negligent or a manufacturer or seller knowingly violated the law    And cases involving an injury caused by a physical defect with the weapon when it was used as intended What Sanders and his campaign said prior to Jan 16 On numerous occasions  Sanders or his aides have expressed comfort with his past vote In June 2015  Weaver  Sanders campaign manager  told Politico   I believe he would make the same vote today In October  at a Democratic debate in Las Vegas  Sanders said   If somebody has a gun and it falls into the hands of a murderer and that murderer kills somebody with the gun  do you hold the gun manufacturer responsible? Not any more than you would hold a hammer company responsible if somebody beats somebody over the head with a hammer That is not what a lawsuit should be about Sanders continued to make similar arguments into January 2016 Asked by CBS whether gun manufacturers should be held accountable for gun deaths  Sanders said  Of course not  that doesnt make any sense  he said  while adding that if guns fall into the hands of criminals  Of course you hold the gun manufacturers liable At the same time  Sanders has increasingly fine tuned his stance  saying hed be open to reconsidering his vote on the 2005 measure In an October 2015 interview on NBCs Meet the Press  Sanders said he was willing to see changes in the gun liability provision  Can we take another look at that liability issue? Yes Then  in January  a few days before the campaign issued its news release on gun liability  Sanders told a crowd in Iowa  I think we should take another look at that legislation and get rid of those provisions which allow gun manufacturers to act irresponsibly The Jan 16 news release In the news release  Sanders expressed support for the Blumenthal Schiff initiative to rescind the liability portions of the 2005 law The trigger lock and armor piercing ammunition provisions would not be overturned The sponsors said they will try to advance the Equal Access to Justice for Victims of Gun Violence Act as an amendment to an appropriations bill  according to the New York Times On the Jan 17 edition of NBCs Meet the Press  Sanders explained that in 2005  there were things in  the bill  that I did not like and I was willing to rethink We have rethought it Theres a bill apparently being introduced  I like that bill  it makes some good changes and we will be supportive of it Sanders did say in his news release that he will be proposing an amendment to the Blumenthal and Schiff bills to require the Commerce Department to monitor and report on the laws impact in rural areas on the availability of hunting supplies  including firearms  sold by non negligent local gun stores This  he indicated  was consistent with his past concerns about the threat of lawsuits against small gun shops serving primarily rural areas of Vermont,3,0,930,real

tweeted Trump  who announced in May that the United States was pulling out of the agreement to curb Irans nuclear ambitions We found that the claim lacks evidence Our fact checking friends at Factnameh   a Canada based website that fact checks claims about Iran  found that the statement by the Iranian official has no evidence to back it up Factnamehcom found that the original source of the claim was an anti regime website called Amad News It published the claim on Feb 14  2017  quoting an anonymous informed source Fox News attributed report to one Iranian official Fox News attributed its report to Hojjat al Islam Mojtaba Zolnour  chairman of Irans parliamentary nuclear committee and a member of its national security and foreign affairs committee Zolnour made the allegations during an interview with the countrys Etemad newspaper  cited by the countrys Fars News agency  a semi official organ of the Iranian government Zolnour claimed that the citizenships were granted as a favor to senior Iranian officials linked to President Hassan Rouhani  Fox said When Obama  during the negotiations about the JCPOA  Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action  commonly referred to as the Iran deal   decided to do a favor to these men  he granted citizenship to 2 500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2 500 Iranians  he claimed Fox News analyst and former Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told Fox News  This sounds like totally made up BS Other officials in the Obama administration also said the statement was false  Richard Nephew  who works for Columbia University and was the State Departments lead sanctions expert from August 2013 to December 2014  told PolitiFact that the claim is entirely nonsense It would have made no sense for us to have done this and less sense for the officials to have agreed requested citizenship  he said While I was on the team  this wasnt even discussed  considered or thought about I would bet any sum youd care to wager that this didnt come up after I left the talks And  it is worth noting that after years of congressional inquiry into this  we never heard of it I find it hard to believe thats because this one opposition politician in Iran was the only person who knew about it Suzanne Maloney   deputy director of the Foreign Policy Program at the Brookings Institution  who served on States Policy Planning Staff from 2005 07  also expressed disbelief  She held a part time outside advisor role during the early part of Obamas administration  Maloney said the issue of US citizenship or green cards has long been a contentious one within the Iranian establishment There are a few Iranians within the ruling establishment who have or had US citizenship or permanent residency  typically dating from the pre revolutionary period There are also Iranian officials whose children have attended US universities and stayed in the United States  or married dual nationals and obtained residency or citizenship Given the longstanding estrangement between the US and Iran  the allegation alone is used as a smear  to impugn the patriotism and question the motives of rival officials by essentially accusing them of hypocrisy and ideological opportunism  she said Zolnour is a hard line cleric  she said So its not surprising that a politician who is critical of the nuclear deal would use this line of attack  especially in the aftermath of President Trumps dismantling of the deal  which has generated an intense backlash toward the proponents of the agreement  Maloney said And yes  Iranians of all political stripes are prone to indulging fairly creative conspiracy theories  especially hardliners and especially conspiracy theories about the US Ali Vaez  the anti war Crisis Groups Iran Project Director   told PoltiiFact that Zolnour is a firebrand who is well known for his false claims Vaez said that Zolnour is using this claim to undermine President Hassan Rouhani and his allies as the parliament is trying to pass a bill to ban dual nationals from serving in the Iranian government We emailed the Diamond and Silk website and did not get a reply The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment to Fox News  and we didnt get a reply to our email State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert was asked about Trumps tweet at the July 3 press briefing and referred reporters to homeland security,1,0,867,fake

Thats the point presidential candidate Sen Marco Rubio  R Fla    a vocal critic of the negotiations    made on National Public Radio April 13  I still have tremendous questions about whether this deals even viable  he said The Iranians are now saying that what were saying the deal is and what they understand it to be are two different things President Barack Obama and the other negotiating parties    Iran  China  France  Russia  the United Kingdom and Germany    hit a milestone in early April They established a framework agreement that lays the foundations for a final deal  to be reached in the summer So we wondered  Are the United States and Irans descriptions of what the deal will entail so different? Its important to keep in mind that the agreement reached in Lausanne  Switzerland  was a framework  not a final deal The framework itself isnt publicly available  and the parties still have plenty of details to hammer out For these reasons  theres room for the negotiating parties to fill in the blanks with details that appeal to constituents Even so  some of the differences between the United States and Irans descriptions of the agreement are significant    such as the timeline for sanctions relief and how much access international inspectors will have to Irans nuclear facilities Back in April  Iran and the United States decided to set these differences aside  hoping to successfully address them later  said Matthew Kroenig  a professor at Georgetown University and an expert in nuclear weapons policy These differences are important  however  and could very well kill the deal  Kroenig said Officials in both countries have said the others descriptions run counter to what was decided in Lausanne  and if they cant agree  the potential for a deal might die Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammed Javad Zarif tweeted and said on Iranian television that the American factsheet was in contradiction to the framework agreement  according to the New York Times Responding to a question about Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khameneis pushback against the deal  Obama told reporters April 11   If that is his understanding and his position    in ways that cant be squared with our concern about being able to embark on vigorous inspections to assure that Iran isnt cheating under any program  and that we dont have the capacity to snap back sanctions when we see a potential violation    then were probably not going to get a deal Significant discrepancies We reached out to Rubios team and didnt hear back But Iran and the United States have each produced factsheets about the agreement  in addition to a joint statement from the negotiating parties If you want to look at the details yourself  Harvard Universitys Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs put together a side by side comparison of all three fact sheets and relevant political statements A major discrepancy between Iran and the United States is the timeline and conditions for pulling back sanctions against Iran According to the American factsheet  the United States and European Union will suspend sanctions against Iran after it has been verified that Iran is complying with the deal The sanctions can snap back into place if it is discovered that Iran is not complying Irans summary  on the other hand  says the sanctions will be revoked as soon as the deal is implemented    distinguishing a permanent change from the ability to reinstate sanctions Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said April 4   During the talks we  both sides  always talked about lifting economic  financial  and banking sanctions We never talked about the suspension of the sanctions  and if that were the case  no agreement would form Additionally  Obama said the sanctions relief would be phased in  while Rouhani said the sanctions would be canceled on the very first day of the implementation of the deal Another point of contention is the level of access international inspectors will have to Irans nuclear facilities The American factsheet has several bullet points emphasizing that the International Atomic Energy Agencys inspectors will have near universal access to Iranian nuclear facilities Obama called it unprecedented  noting that Iran will also be required to grant access to the material supply chain in addition to the facilities themselves Irans summary of the framework says much less about verification processes It says Iran will comply with some of the agencys protocols on a voluntary and temporary basis Additionally  Irans religious leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said international inspectors will not have unlimited access to nuclear facilities It must absolutely not be allowed for them to infiltrate into the countrys defense and security domain under the pretext of inspections  Khamenei said  as reported by the Wall Street Journal While the discrepancies over sanctions and levels of verification are important  others are a just matter of spin  said Graham Allison  director of Harvards Belfer Center and a nuclear weapons analyst For example  regarding one of Irans uranium enrichment facilities  the United States factsheet says  Almost two thirds of Fordows centrifuges and infrastructure will be removed Irans factsheet  on the other hand says  More than 1 000 centrifuge machines and all related infrastructure in Fordow will be preserved and maintained Both descriptions are accurate    Fordow currently has 2 710 centrifuges  and the deal will lower that number to 1 044 While the differences in the public descriptions may be striking  Allison said people should not pass judgment on the final deal yet  given that the real negotiations are conducted in private  meaning the real contents of the deal are private  too Poisonous political divides in both Washington and Tehran mean that a host of commentators and even journalists seize on  and even exaggerate  these differences for their own political ends  Allison said,2,0,976,real

And how would you address it? The federal government  Paul said  adding that   to his dismay   It used to be the policy of the Republican Party to get rid of the Department of Education We finally get in charge and a chance to do something so we double the size of the Department of Education In fact  Paul understates the shift The size of the Education Department nearly quadrupled between 1994 and 2006  increasing from  27 billion to  100 billion  Even when adjusting for inflation   the 1994 budget rises to  368 billion when calculated in 2006 dollars   the increase is huge  nearly triple  172 percent  Much of the increase came as a result of  the 2001 education law known as the No Child Left Behind Act In return for implementing a regimen of student testing and teacher accountability  states received an infusion of federal funds We should point out that federal funding contributes a small portion to education funding for grades K 12 Even under the No Child law  states and localities contribute 83 percent of K 12 education funding The federal contribution is 8 percent  private sources provide 9 percent  according to Education Department calculations The  100 billion budget in 2006 was by far the largest ever  and something of an anomaly It marked a substantial increase from the 2005 funding level of  715 billion In 2007  the budget fell to  674 billion  a 75 percent increase over 1994 levels in inflation adjusted terms   big but not quite double The bump in 2006 was the result of a massive increase in mandatory spending related to student loan processing and to a one time infusion of  43 billion to cover shortfalls in funding for grants to university students Student loans make up the bulk of the mandatory spending  meaning that federal law compels the department to cover the cost of guaranteeing and directly making loans to students no matter how the cost fluctuates due to interest rates or the number of student applications Most other programs   including No Child Left Behind funding   are considered discretionary  meaning the amounts get decided each year But whether the spending is mandatory or discretionary  Paul  a libertarian who does not believe the federal government has a role to play in education policy  says its better left to the states Many of his Republican colleagues  as evidenced by the  73 billion increase in funding the Education Department enjoyed while they controlled Congress and the White House  apparently do not agree Pauls statement  therefore  is True,2,0,571,real

Just as individuals borrow money to buy a car or a house  states like California borrow money to fund their budget and projects One way that they do this is by issuing General Obligation bonds And just as a bank tries to determine the likelihood that an individual will pay back a loan  plus interest  on time  credit rating agencies try to determine if states will pay back the money they borrow  plus interest  on time The rating on a bond answers a very simple question with an often complicated answer  how likely is this issuer  California  to not make good on its debt  said Satya Thallam  associate director of economic education at the George Mason Universitys Mercatus Center In the spectrum of bonds  GO bonds tend to be the lowest risk because they are not tied to any specific revenue stream  but are backed by the full faith and credit of the issuer  he said That means California promises to use all tools at its disposal  including tax increases  to pay the loan on time The three biggest US credit rating agencies    Standard and Poors  Moodys  and Fitch    have all given Californias GO bonds the lowest ratings of any state   Standard and Poors  Gave California an A  rating with a negative outlook Their rating starts at AAA  then AA  A  then BBB and so forth down to D   Fitch  Recently gave California an A  with a stable outlook   Moodys  At the time Brown made the claim  California was alone in the cellar of Moodys ratings among states But the agency recently downgraded Illinois to the same level Moodys uses a slightly different rating system Its highest rating is Aaa  then Aa1  Aa2  Aa3  A1  A2  A3  Baa1 and so forth down to C California and Illinois are rated A1 But none of these ratings are quite as bad as they sound Gabriel Petek  the primary author of S Ps report on the California GO Bond rating  said that the A  rating is still strong in the grand scheme of the rating universe But relatively speaking  the risks seems incrementally greater to us compared to other states Still  why are Californias bonds riskier than those of other states? Two of the biggest problems are institutional constraints and partisan politicking In California  the legislature requires a two thirds majority to pass a budget and to raise taxes That makes passing a budget  let alone a balanced one  very difficult  because the minority party  which has more than one third of the votes  has a great deal of leverage Furthermore  the state constitution requires that the legislature spend at least 40 percent of the budget on education  which further decreases legislative flexibility As a result  it is not uncommon for the budget to be passed late  leaving the state short of cash In 2009  California started issuing IOUs to non priority payees such as tax refund recipients  in order to be able to continue reimbursing for GO bonds Petek said that those IOUs were good and bad  The ability of the controller to issue IOUs when cash is or is expected to become unacceptably low both protects the states credit quality  and at the same time illustrates that the states budget and cash problems have reached a fairly serious point California is also feeling the bite of the recession more than many other states because it derives 50 percent of its revenue from income taxes  much of it from capital gains taxes So when the stock market took a sharp dip  so did Californias revenue Brown was right about California having the lowest credit rating Illinois recent descent to Californias level in Moodys ratings happened after Browns post  so we are not counting that in our assessment,2,0,780,real

Mrs Clinton told the Arkansas Democrat Gazette in 1984 The initiatives won resounding approval in a special session of the Legislature in late 1983 But was Mrs Clinton a chairwoman in name only?

The Clinton campaign declined to comment The ambassador A spokeswoman for Paul told us he was referring to Scott Gration  a former Obama advisor who left his post as ambassador to Kenya three years ago After less than a year and half on the job  Gration resigned in June 2012  while Clinton was secretary  after reading a draft of a highly critical audit by the State Departments Office of the Inspector General  which works independently  Among Grations many failings was his continued usage of a personal email account  according to the report Unsurprisingly  Grations drama resurfaced when the Clinton email controversy first erupted in March 2015  and some claimed that Gration was fired for his  Hillary like use of the email   Gration used a Gmail account  Gration himself called the State Departments treatment of him a double standard PunditFact  however  found that most of the reports inflated the significance of the personal email Grations grating style of management  uncooperative attitude and disruptive initiatives were more pressing to the State Department Out of more than 80 mission chiefs  he ranked last for interpersonal relations  next to last on managerial skill and attention to morale  and third to last on overall scores  according to the audit Compared to these issues  the email problem played a minor role  according to Ronald Neumann  who served as an American ambassador three times  most recently in Afghanistan from 2005 07 It could be an important issue  but when you screw up as many things as this guy did  its hard to get through to that one  Neumann told PunditFact  The admonishment Pauls claim  however  is more tempered  and thus more accurate That audit did indeed admonish Gration for his email habits The fourth bullet point on the reports summary reads  The Ambassadors greatest weakness is his reluctance to accept clear cut US Government decisions He made clear his disagreement with Washington policy decisions and directives concerning the safe havening in Nairobi of families of Department employees who volunteered to serve in extreme hardship posts  the creation of a freestanding Somalia Unit  and the nonuse of commercial email for official government business  including Sensitive But Unclassified information Notwithstanding his talk about the importance of mission staff doing the right thing  the Ambassador by deed or word has encouraged it to do the opposite The report describes Grations actions in detail starting on page 43   He deliberately defied the State Departments rule on communication by installing a commercial Internet connection in his embassy office bathroom and authorizing his embassy staff to use personal emails He has willfully disregarded Department regulations on the use of commercial email for official government business  the report says  Ars Technica   a technology news site  put it even more bluntly  Gration was the end user from hell for an understaffed IT team in a politically sensitive outpost The report also spells out the reasons for the policy  Unauthorized systems increase the risk for hacks and loss of records It then states that the use of personal emails must be limited to maintaining communications during emergencies and recommended the embassy stop using the unofficial email accounts It is unclear if top State Department brass slammed Gration for violating the personal email policy  as Paul suggests We found no on the record condemnations from department officials  though Gration said multiple times that Clintons chief of staff fired him after reading the report An audit by an inspector general is different than Clinton directly criticizing Gration for the practice Comparison to Clinton In short  the departments watchdogs chided Gration for a number of issues  including his personal email use But how closely did his improper email habits mirror Clintons? Clinton exclusively used a personal email account during her tenure as the countrys top diplomat At the time  there was no law prohibiting the practice  one was put in place in 2014  There was  however  a long standing policy against using personal emails  reiterated in a 2011 memo from the State Department under Clinton Gration  for his part  used both  although he very infrequently logged onto his classified account  the report says Without more information  its hard to compare the security risks of both setups Gration likely channeled his personal emails through an unsecured Internet connection despite repeated warnings  according to the  Washington Post  As for Clinton  her personal email was relayed through a private server guarded by the Secret Service  Clinton said at a March press conference  We dont know if the State Department signed off on her private server  but it was aware of the servers existence The emails were encrypted after March 2009  according to her security provider   though theres still debate over the accounts security Overall  an expert told us its an apples to apples comparison  though he cautioned that the inspector general report does not address why Gration was using a personal email   According to Gration  he couldnt get news alerts through the official State Department server  The similarities between the two situations are striking  and it is fair to compare them  said Douglas Cox  a law professor at the City University of New York  who studies records preservation Both were in senior leadership positions Both made a regrettable decision to use non official email  which raised security and record keeping concerns that should have been obvious And both refused to accept that their continuous use of non official email violated State Department rules Cox pointed out that the report condemned Grations email usage as a failure in leadership that sapped the morale of his staff The same criticism could apply to Clinton  who  as secretary of state  should be held to a higher standard than Gration  Cox argued The buck should have stopped with her  and she should have been leading by example  he said,2,0,1109,real

Hugely The new drug benefit was used by 345 million beneficiaries in 2010  and that number is projected to reach 405 million in 2015  Most were already enrolled in Medicare  Through 2010  Medicare Part D had cost  203 billion  according to the Congressional Budget Office  The program is expected to cost another  391 billion through 2015  according to CBO projections It was certainly not the first time that Congress tried to improve the system of private plans within Medicare But its fair to say with the addition of the drug benefit  it was the biggest expansion of the program since the beginning  said Paul Van de Water  a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities  a liberal research group  It  was filling a major gap that existed since the beginning of the program  he said That was a real  fundamental change,1,0,593,real

In this fact check  we assess whether Trump has changed his mind on abortion Fiorinas staff apparently was so sure this would come up  a day after the debate  they posted a page on their campaign website with supporting information They cited articles from the Washington Post and National Journal that documented Trumps shift from saying he was pro choice to now saying he is pro life I am very pro choice Trumps flirtations with a presidential bid have put him on record at various moments in a couple of election cycles In 1999  he appeared on NBCs  Meet the Press   when he was thinking about a third party run I am very pro choice  Trump said I hate the concept of abortion I hate it I hate everything it stands for I cringe when I hear people debating the subject When pressed on whether he would ban a procedure called partial birth by abortion foes  Trump said  No I would not I am pro choice in every respect as far as it goes  but I just hate it In his 2000 book  The America We Deserve   Trump affirmed his basic position  but reversed his stand on that one particular procedure There are some issues I dont want to say much about I support a womans right to choose  for example  but I am uncomfortable with the procedures When Tim Russert asked me on Meet the Press if I would ban partial birth abortion if I were president  my pro choice instincts led me to say no After the show  I consulted two doctors I respect and  upon learning more about this procedure  I have concluded that I would indeed support a ban So  as of 2000  Trump has pro choice instincts Im pro life In mid February 2011  with Trump again fueling speculation that he would run for president  he spoke at the annual meeting of the Conservative Political Action Committee  In his 14 minute speech  he made this simple declaration  I am pro life A few months later in April  he sat down with the Christian Broadcasting Network s political correspondent  who asked if he would really stand by his new belief Here is what Trump said  One thing about me  Im a very honorable guy Im pro life  but I changed my view a number of years ago One of the reasons I changed   one of the primary reasons   a friend of mine  his wife was pregnant  in this case married She was pregnant  and  he didnt really want the baby And he was telling me the story Hes crying as hes telling me They ended up for some reason  amazingly  through luck because they didnt have the right timing  he ends up having the baby  and the baby is the apple of his eye He said  its the greatest thing thats ever happened to him And you know  heres a baby that wasnt going to be let into life And I heard this  and some other stories  and I am pro life So  by 2011  Trump opposed abortion These days  he often re tells the story about his friends unplanned child A curious interruption Trump clarified his stance on abortion in a January interview with Mark Halperin of Bloomberg News  Trump said the only exceptions to banning abortions would be to protect the life of the mother or in cases of incest or rape But we noted this twist in that brief discussion  Trump  With caveats  life of the mother  incest and rape And thats where I stand So Im pro life  but with the caveats Its life of the mother very important  incest and rape Halperin  So say a woman is pregnant and its not in any of those exception categories and she chooses to have an abortion  should she    Trump  It depends when  it depends when It depends when Halperin  Well lets say early in her pregnancy Trump  Excuse me If its not in any of those    pro life  Mark its very simple Pro life Trump interrupted Halperin to say it depends when We reached out to Trumps campaign and asked what he meant We did not hear back,1,0,814,real

According to data  the answer is yes In 2012 2013  the New Orleans School District had 841  of all its students attending charter schools In 2013 14 that number increased to 91 percent  New Orleans charter school rate is uncharacteristically high even compared to other Louisiana districts  as the following chart shows Why do students overwhelmingly attend charter schools in New Orleans? The answer may have something to do with the sheer number of charter schools there Of the 82 schools currently in the Orleans Parish  76 are charter schools  Only 6 are non charter public schools Why so many? The history of charter schools in New Orleans tracks back to 1995 That year  Louisiana passed its first charter school law  which allowed up to eight volunteer districts to have charter schools established In 1997  the law was changed so that any districts could volunteer  although the number of charter schools statewide was capped at 42 In 1998  the first charter school opened in New Orleans However  it would be almost a decade before charter schools became prevalent in there The Louisiana Legislature established the Recovery School District in 2003 The RSD is a special school district run by the Louisiana Department of Education that intervenes in the management of chronically low performing schools That year  chronically low performing schools were defined as those that earned the lowest performance label  Academically Unacceptable  AUS   for four consecutive years That first year  17 schools were identified for takeover Sixteen of those schools were in New Orleans After the Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education gave the RSD the green light to take control of the schools  the RSD had the choice of either directly operat ing  the schools itself  or to contract with universities or non profit organizations to operate them as charter schools Laura Hawkins  the deputy chief of staff at RSD  said the RSD always had the goal of establishing charter schools  believing from the start that it was the best strategy Still  before 2005  there were only a handful of charter schools in New Orleans Charter schools were a nascent movement  said Hawkins And then Hurricane Katrina came Brian Beabout  a professor of educational leadership at the University of New Orleans  has studied education reform in post Katrina New Orleans In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina   New Orleans  temporarily lost 100 percent of its students and did not reopen a single school for more than two months  Beabout wrote in a 2007 article  When the Orleans Parish School Board did reopen public schools in January 2006  those schools were reopened as charters Why? OPSB opted to open the schools as charter schools to take advantage of the US schools  said a Cowen Institute report   The OPSB  had easy access to government money  said Hawkins Part of the Katrina legacy After the hurricane  many in New Orleans realized they had the opportunity to start with a  clean educational slate  and restructure the school system In response  the state Legislature introduced Act 35  This  amendment changed the focus from chronically failing individual schools and added adistrict in academic crisis   Beabout said  The amendment  was tailored specifically to wrest control of New Orleans public schools from the locally elected school board and put them in the hands of the RSD They defined any district with a certain percent of failing schools as in crisis and took control of all schools in the district which performed below the state average Initially  114 schools were transferred over the RSD for control The Cowen Institute reports that under Act 35  the RSD was empowered to lease  rebuild  or renovate the school facilities as necessary for the successful operation of schools  but it could not sell any school buildings  as they still belonged to the OPSB Because of the sudden increase of schools given to it for control  the RSD did not have enough approved charter organizations established Because of this  the RSD took direct control of some schools as a school district Over the years  as more charters were established  the number of schools run directly by the RSD decreased In 2014  the RSD became a 100 percent charter school district  For the record  all of this largely played out before Jindal was elected governor in 2007,4,0,844,real
9802,2014-08-21T13:52:02-04:00,2014,timecom,Rand Paul,Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts,With heavily armored vehicles stationed in the streets and law enforcement officers dressed in camouflage  many have dubbed Ferguson  Mo  a  war zone  After a white Ferguson police officer shot and killed black teenager Michael Brown Aug 9  much of the conversation has focused on race relations  and the interactions between police and the community Theres also been criticism of local police forces using military style equipment and generally giving the appearance of conducting a military operation Sen Rand Paul  R Ky  weighed in on this topic in a Time magazine column   where he said big governments to blame for this trend Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement Many recent media reports have tied police militarization to a federal program that gives surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies Rep Hank Johnson  D Ga  has announced that hes working on a bill to amend this program  in order to scale back police militarization  in light of the situation in Ferguson We wanted to know more about the program and what experts had to say about it They told us that the program certainly has contributed to a militarized police force  but thats not the only reason What is this program  and is it to blame? Pauls talking about the 1033 program  known as such because its outlined in section 1033 of the 1997 National Defense Authorization Act Congress first approved the program in the 1990 National Defense Authorization Act  then section 1208   as part of the countrys war on drugs  which began in the 1970s Law enforcement agencies felt outgunned    police carried handguns  while drug criminals wielded assault rifles However  much of the equipment the agencies wanted was far out of their price range The 1033 program allows local law enforcement agencies to acquire surplus military equipment  at nearly no cost  they have to pay for transporting the equipment  This ranges from field gear    like assault weapons  armored vehicles  night vision goggles and bulletproof vests    to office supplies    like filing cabinets  computers and desks More than 8 000 agencies participate in the 1033 program  which has given out more than  5 billion in property since it started  according to the website of the Defense Logistics Agency   the government body that oversees the program  To be clear  the incentive here is the free equipment alone  not any additional payment or reward for accepting it  Law enforcement agencies apply for specific equipment through the Defense Logistics Agency  Agencies are given preference if they request equipment specifically for counter drug and counter terrorism purposes Additionally  since 9 11  law enforcement agencies have received grants from the Department of Homeland Security to address potential terrorist threats  and some have used those grants to purchase military gear Public opinion on police using military equipment varies with context  said Jim Bueermann  president of the Police Foundation and a former police chief For example  in the case of a major bank robbery where multiple robbers have machine guns and are holding people hostage  the community would likely be glad their local police has comparable weapons  an armored vehicle and protective gear However  when police break out that sort of equipment and military style tactics at a peaceful protest  they look understandably bad  Bueermann said For example  HBO television host John Oliver ridiculed police in Keene  NH  recently for requesting a military grade armored personnel truck  citing the towns annual pumpkin festival as a potential terrorist target  We rated Olivers statement True   What else is at play? We spoke with many experts  and all agreed that there is an upward trend of police militarization They said the 1033 program has accelerated this trend  but its not the sole cause Much of the change is rooted in police culture In fact  many of the experts we spoke with said that absent the 1033 program  police would still want military grade equipment    they just wouldnt be able to afford it Militarization is not just equipment    its an ideology and a mindset  said Victor Kappeler  associate dean of justice studies at Eastern Kentucky University The shift from a community service culture to one that is more militaristic began in the 1960s with the rise of SWAT teams    made prominent by the Los Angeles Police Department and their response to the violent Watts Riots  said Brian Buchner  president of the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement Police departments across the country quickly created their own SWAT teams elite squads that used military like tactics Police started to use SWAT like tactics in less hostile situations    such as no knock raids to execute low level drug busts    because of a small  and in some cases unreasonable   fear that they would encounter heavily armed suspects  Buchner said That training seeped into other parts of police operations and police culture  Buchner said The 1033 program has exacerbated the problem  because in the past  when police agencies didnt have this equipment  they were unable to act as a military force  Kappeler said Instead of responding to a protest with armored vehicles  they would have had to address the issue in a community based way But its not just the government pushing this equipment on law enforcement agencies Private defense manufacturers have also started to make dual purpose equipment that they can market to the military  as well as civilian law enforcement agencies  said Kathleen Campbell  a professor at the US Military Academy at West Point who studies role convergence between police and the military  Campbell asked us to note that her views and research are her own and do not reflect the views of West Point  the army or the federal government  Now when police officers see military style equipment and uniforms in catalogs  they think thats what theyre supposed to look like    perpetuating the culture  said John DeCarlo  an associate professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former police chief  in a  Washington Post  interview Culture spillover also comes from interactions between the police and military  Campbell said  noting that the two collaborate in anti drug and anti terror efforts Aspects of police work that mirror the military    like officer hierarchy and a focus on discipline    make the profession a good fit for former military personnel A 2010 Bureau of Labor Statistics study found that 10 percent of all employed male veterans ages 18 to 54 work in some sort of protective service  which includes police  sheriff officers  correctional officers  bailiffs and security workers The recent recession also could have forced police to lose sight of community policing  Bueermann said Stripped down to their bare bones  some agencies have lost community policing positions  like school resource officers  and are left only with the law enforcement positions This makes them appear less like they are there to help the community and more like they are there to control it And it has made agencies more inclined to take advantage of programs like 1033 because they can get free equipment,2,0,1198,real

Extreme beauty is a good thing  but Colorados no place for Bucks extreme ideas We fact checked the charge that Buck wants to privatize Social Security   and we rated that statement Half True We found that Buck has been clear that he does not want to change the program for current retirees or those close to retiring This time we wanted to look at Bucks views on abortion During a debate on NBCs Meet the Press on Oct 17  moderator David Gregory asked Buck about waffling on issues like abortion  which made us wonder if Bennets charge that Buck wants to outlaw abortion  even in cases of rape or incest was true We want to be clear here that were not checking whether Bucks views on abortion are extreme but only whether the Bennet ad accurately characterizes them Our first stop was Bucks website As a father of two  Ken believes in the value of life and is opposed to abortion except to protect the life of the mother  the site says As US Senator  Ken will oppose federal funding of abortion and will fight to protect the life of the unborn We then turned to news coverage of Bucks public statements Buck has said in response to questions from voters that he opposes abortion and that includes pregnancies that result from rape or incest I dont believe in the exceptions of rape or incest I believe that the only exception  I guess  is life of the mother  Buck said And that is only if its truly life of the mother To me  you cant say youre pro life and say    if there is  and its a very rare situation where one life would have to cease for the other life to exist But in that very rare situation  we may have to take the life of the child to save the life of the mother In that rare situation  I am in favor of that exception But  other than that  I have no exceptions in my position In the course of our research  we noted two instances in which Buck has changed position on abortion related issues  but neither one was about exceptions for rape or incest Earlier in the campaign  Buck indicated he favored a state constitutional amendment that would have granted personhood to people from the beginning of biological development Later  he backed off full support for the amendment  because some people believe the amendment will outlaw some forms of birth control I have said that I am in favor of personhood as a concept  Buck said in an interview with Bob Schieffer on CBSs Face the Nation I am not taking a position on any of the state amendments  and I have said over and over again    and it has been reported over and over again    that I am not in favor of banning any common forms of birth control in Colorado or in the United States His website also says  Ken believes life begins at conception and does not favor doing away with common forms of birth control  like the pill The other question has been whether Buck would vote to confirm presidential nominees who favor abortion rights Buck indicated earlier in the campaign that he would not confirm such nominees  but later he said he would only oppose nominees who are activists for abortion rights I wont use abortion as a litmus test with a pro choice individual  Buck told Schieffer Someone that is an activist on the abortion issue  I think  goes outside the pale  and I cannot support an activist on the abortion issue To be clear  we did not find any instance of Buck changing position from the view that abortion law should not include exceptions for rape or incest And a campaign spokesperson reaffirmed that position Ken is pro life  and only has one exception    thats when the life of the mother is at risk  said Owen Loftus But Loftus also said that Buck is focused on economic issues and government spending The reality is that the Senate only deals with a few abortion related issues    partial birth abortion and public funding Ken would not support either This ad is another example of how Michael Bennet wants to talk about anything but the issues that Coloradans care about    creating jobs  controlling spending and getting our economy back on track In reviewing the record  Buck has said he opposes abortion  even in the cases of rape or incest We did not find any evidence of him changing position on that issue over the course of the campaign,3,0,899,real

In media interviews  he has said theres no obligation to defend them if they dont pay up Trumps campaign did not respond to requests for comment NATO and unfulfilledobligations Clinton is talking about Trumps comments about NATO during the campaign NATO  founded after World War II by the United States and 11 other members  now has 28 members  all agreeing to use political and military means to safeguard members freedom and security Article 5 of the Washington Treaty    NATOs founding treaty    says parties agree that an attack against one shall be considered an attack against all  and agree to assist members who are attacked NATO invoked Article 5 for the first time after the 9 11 terrorist attacks against the United States To back Clintons claim  her campaign directed us to a July 2016 New York Times interview with Trump on foreign policy Trump was asked about defending small Baltic States that have recently joined NATO against Russia  such as Estonia  Latvia and Lithuania Mr Trump said that if Russia attacked them  he would decide whether to come to their aid only after reviewing if those nations have fulfilled their obligations to us   the New York Times reported According to a transcript of the interview with the New York Times  Trump also said many NATO members arent paying their bills Reporter David E Sanger  Thats true  but we are treaty obligated under NATO  forget the bills part Trump  You cant forget the bills They have an obligation to make payments Many NATO nations are not making payments  are not making what theyre supposed to make Thats a big thing You cant say forget that Sanger  My point here is  can the members of NATO  including the new members in the Baltics  count on the United States to come to their military aid if they were attacked by Russia? And count on us fulfilling our obligations   Trump  Have they fulfilled their obligations to us? If they fulfill their obligations to us  the answer is yes Reporter Maggie Haberman  And if not? Trump  Well  Im not saying if not Im saying  right now there are many countries that have not fulfilled their obligations to us So in that interview  Trump argued other NATO countries had to fulfill their obligations to receive the United States military aid Asked to clarify what would happen to countries who hadnt paid  he demurred In May 2016  Trump also told the Wall Street Journal that when other NATO nations dont pay up  theyve backed out of their obligations  then we no longer have an obligation to defend them Trump said he did not want to get out of NATO  but wanted the countries of NATO to pay us Theres a problem with the way Trump has talked about NATO country payments No one in NATO actuallypays us to defend them  as Trump repeatedly claims  nor is there any obligation to do so  said Ivo H Daalder  president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs who previously served as ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama Our commitment to come to our allies defense    and theirs to ours    isnt in return for any payment  Daalder said It is an unconditional treaty obligation every ally entered into freely when they signed the North Atlantic Treaty NATO allies pay into military and civilian budgets on the basis of agreed cost shares  said Jeff Rathke  senior fellow and deputy director of the Europe Program at Center for Strategic and International Studies And to be clear  funds are paid to NATO  not to the United States Beyond the common funding of certain capabilities  each NATO ally is also responsible for spending on its own defense  said Rathke  who served on NATOs International Staff from 2009 to 2011 Allies are to spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense  though many are not meeting the guideline Jorge Benitez  director of NATOSource at the Atlantic Council  says if Trump were elected president and decided not to help defend a NATO ally under attack  it would be the end of NATO This would be a very damaging blow to US national security and would also hurt our alliances in other parts of the world  Benitez said,4,0,818,real

6267,2012-07-16T16:39:48-04:00,2012,wwwyoutubecom,Barack Obama,Says Mitt Romney had millions in a Swiss bank account,President Barack Obamas re election campaign is using hard edged irony to attack Mitt Romney in a new ad that pairs Romney singing America the Beautiful with a series of claims about Bain Capital and his use of offshore accounts in his personal finances In this item  well look at the claim that Romney had millions in a Swiss bank account Romney has released tax returns for 2010 and an estimated tax return for 2011   in addition to a number of financial disclosure forms  Each of these forms is lengthy and  unless youre an accountant  difficult to decipher However  the question of whether the Obama campaign is correct to say that Romney had millions in a Swiss bank account is not in doubt  since the trustee for the Romney familys financial investments    Brad Malt of the law firm Ropes   Gray    acknowledged it in an on the record call with journalists on Jan 24  2012 Malt said on the call  Yeah  it occurs to me that one other question that came up   Why is there a Swiss bank account listed on the Romneys tax return? It is listed because I set that account up for diversification in 2003  when I became trustee of the blind trusts It is a bank account Nothing more  nothing less An ordinary bank account It earns some income  which is fully reported on the Form 1040 in the  2010  tax return Youll see approximately  1 700 of interest earned by this account  which is reported The tax is fully paid just as if this were a US bank account  nothing more complicated than that Malt added  By the way  I did close this account in early 2010 It no longer exists Reporters on the call offered two follow up questions about the Swiss bank account One asked  Why was that Swiss bank account closed in 2010? Malt responded  I previously said that I regularly review Gov Romneys investments and just in connection with one of my periodic reviews  I decided that this account wasnt serving any particular purpose It might or might not be consistent with Gov Romneys political views You know  again  taxes were all fully paid  etc  but it just wasnt worth it  and I closed the account The second question asked the Romney camp to elaborate on which institution held the Swiss account  how much the account held and whether the account also worked with any trusts or foundations Malt responded that the Swiss bank account was in the Ann Romney blind trust It held approximately  3 million It was just an investment of the trust    the bank account of the trust    which  as I mentioned  I have subsequently closed The bank was  sorry  Union Bank Switzerland    UBS Malts comments confirm that Romney had millions in a Swiss bank account because the couple filed their returns jointly  and the campaign has disclosed tax returns for Ann Romneys trusts and family trusts  not just Romneys funds Meanwhile  the Romney campaign also retroactively disclosed that the couple had a Swiss account in his 2006 presidential financial disclosure form  apparently the same one that was closed in 2010 In the 2006 disclosure form  the UBS money market account was listed as being worth between  1 million and  5 million We should note that theres no indication that Romney did anything improper by having some of his assets in a Swiss bank account    assets  well reiterate  that were placed in the account by Malt  not by Romney The purpose of a blind trust is to have a money manager make investment decisions so that a public official is protected from the appearance of a conflict of interest The Romney campaign said the account was legal and disclosed to the IRS and the US Treasury Income from the account was included in the Romneys tax returns and all US taxes due were paid during the period  the campaign said,2,0,651,real
186,2007-11-27T00:00:00-05:00,2007,wwwvote,Fred Thompson,Im proud to have had a 100 percent pro life voting record,At first  one might wonder  How can former US Sen Fred Thompson claim a 100 percent pro life voting record when the National Right to Life Committee  the nations largest and most prominent antiabortion advocacy group  graded him at only 33 percent during his last term in Congress? And 77 percent the term before that? And 87 percent in the term before that? The answer is in the details As a senator from Tennessee from 1994 to 2002  Thompsons voting record indeed shows he compiled a perfect record on voting against abortion rights  cloning and certain research that many antiabortion advocates find objectionable He voted against a resolution supporting Roe v Wade  the landmark 1973 Supreme Court case that requires all states to permit abortion Several times  he voted for a ban on late term abortion  called partial birth abortion  except when the life of the woman    not her health   is at stake He supported a ban on abortions in US military hospitals and clinics  voted to block federal funding for assisted suicide  and voted to make it a federal crime to transport a minor across state lines for an abortion So whats with the middling marks from the National Right to Life Committees grade  then? The Washington based group  which boasts 3 000 chapters in all 50 states  ranks members of Congress each year on their votes But Thompson was docked not for his votes on so called life issues  instead  he lost points for supporting a series of campaign finance reform bills that sought to limit the contributions or advertising of outside interest groups Many advocacy organizations opposed these reforms because they feared theyd lose influence in Congress In 1995  he also supported a welfare reform bill the group opposed  said David OSteen  executive director of National Right to Life But on matters dearest to their members hearts  Thompson is right on  OSteen said He also voted with the group against cloning and fetal tissue research  and for limits on how federal funding could be used for family planning activities abroad  his voting record shows In fact  the National Right to Life Committee has endorsed him for president Its very fair for him to say that on every bill that came forward  he cast a pro life vote  OSteen said I think hes fairly characterizing this Hes got a very pro life record  and that was a big part of our endorsement    its not just talking the talk  but walking the walk He was there  and he wasnt one of the members that vacillated and you wondered where he was going to be He was solid The ad  which aired first in Iowa  then nationally on Fox News  is designed to help Thompson set himself apart from his chief Republican rivals  former Massachusetts Gov Mitt Romney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani  in the race for the GOP nomination Romney says he now opposes abortion  when he ran for governor  he said he was in favor of abortion rights Giuliani publicly supports abortion rights By contrast  Thompsons commitment in public life to the policies espoused by antiabortion groups has never wavered,4,0,525,real

Obama said One candidates family foundation has saved countless lives around the world The other candidates foundation took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a six foot tall painting of himself Obama added  to laughter  I mean  you know  he had the taste not to go for the 10 foot version  but We have previously written about how the Clinton Foundation helped 9 million people receive lower cost HIV AIDS medicine  as well as the foundations controversies  But what about Obamas statement that Trumps foundation took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a six foot tall painting of himself? The White House confirmed that the statement stems from a widely read Washington Post story by reporter David Fahrenthold  whos written a series of stories about Trump Foundation and has inquired with organizations around the country to see if they actually received money from the real estate mogul Fahrenthold provided new details of his investigations in a Sept 10  2016  Post  article headlined  How Donald Trump retooled his charity to spend other peoples money Based on a review of 17 years of tax filings by the Donald J Trump Foundation and interviews with more than 200 individuals and groups who were listed as recipients of its gifts  Fahrenthold found that nearly all of its money in recent years has come from people other than Trump  with his most recent personal gift to the foundations coffers dating from 2008 Experts told Fahrenthold that such an arrangement is almost unheard of for a family foundation The story by Fahrenthold includes the anecdote referenced by Obama in Philadelphia  which Fahrenthold wrote was one of two cases he found in which Trump used his money from the charity to buy himself a gift By doing so  he wrote  the foundation appeared to be flouting IRS rules by buying items that only seemed to be for Trumps benefit In 2007  for instance  Trump and his wife  Melania  attended a benefit for a childrens charity held at Mar a Lago The nights entertainment was Michael Israel  who bills himself asthe original speed painter His frenetic act involved painting giant portraits in five to seven minutes   then auctioning off the art hed just created He painted Trump Melania Trump bid  10 000 Nobody tried to outbid her The auctioneer was just pretty bold  so he said  You know what just happened  When you started bidding  nobodys going to bid against you  and I think its only fair that you double the bid   Israel said in an interview last week Melania Trump increased her bid to  20 000 I understand it went to one of his golf courses  Israel said of the painting The Trump Foundation paid the  20 000  according to the charity that held the benefit Fahrentholds article notes that the Post submitted detailed questions to the campaign but officials declined to comment The campaign did not respond to an inquiry from PolitiFact for this article We asked Fahrenthold whether Obamas version jibed with his reporting It seems pretty accurate to me  Fahrenthold told PolitiFact I talked to both the charity that held the auction and the artist who made the painting They told me Melania Trump had actually been the one bidding on the painting at the auction  which she won for  20 000    half went to charity  half went to the artist But the actual check came from the Trump Foundation  of which Donald is president and Melania is not an officer of any kind He added that the auction seems to have been held in 2006 but the check wasnt cut until 2007  a year in which almost all of the money in the Trump Foundation was other peoples money Specifically  according to Fahrentholds reporting  the Trump Foundation began that year with  4 238 in the bank Trump himself gave  35 000 to the foundation that year But other donors gave  4055 million  primarily a single  4 million gift from Vince and Linda McMahon  the founders of the WWE wrestling empire Using the most generous calculation  Fahrenthold said  Trumps own money accounted for less than 1 percent of the total amount that entered the foundation that year   4 094 238 So it was almost all other peoples money  he said So where is the painting? Thats a bit more mysterious Even crowdsourcing the search through Twitter hasnt produced a verified image of the painting I cant find the damn thing  Fahrenthold said Its out there somewhere Neither the painter nor the charity    the Childrens Place at Home Safe  in Boca Raton  Fla    have been able to provide a picture of it,3,0,869,real

separation policy inspired several defenses of the practice  with many conservative politicians and pundits arguing that it was a continuation of policies from earlier administrations According to one blog site  Trumps policy was no worse than a pilot program put in place under President Barack Obama Obama administration kept illegal Mexican kids in detention camps asexperiment  said a June 16  2018 headline from the Lid  an online blog Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebooks News Feed  Read more about our partnership with Facebook   Citing a Feb 11  2015  report from the Washington Post  the Lid story compared Trumps policy to Obamas Juvenile Referral Process  a pilot program in south Texas that sought to cut down on smuggling by detaining and questioning unaccompanied minors   known as circuit children   suspected of helping Mexican drug cartels transport people and narcotics across the border The story said Obamas program resulted in border agents tossing some of those kids into internment camps as an experiment Under Obama  young illegal immigrants were put infacilities so they could be squeezed for any information they may or may not have about drug cartels  the story said A program to detain kids is okay under a Democratic Party president  but preventing kids from going to jail with their parents is considered un American when the president is a Republican We decided to check this claim out and see how Trumps policy compared with the Obama program  we found significant differences between the policies and their outcomes The Lid did not respond to a request for comment sent via Facebook Messenger Trumps policy Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued an April memorandum announcing a zero tolerance policy   according to which all immigrants apprehended for illegally crossing the US border were referred for federal prosecution Many immigrants subject to the zero tolerance policy were adults traveling with children Due to a 2015 district court decision   children cannot be held in federal jails with adults facing prosecution Previous administrations shied away from prosecuting adults with children and  after the 2015 decision  tended to release families rather than separate them But the Trump administration  citing its zero tolerance policy  was separating families and placing children in shelters run by the Department of Health and Human Services until they could be released to a sponsor More than 2 300 children were separated from adults between May 5 and June 9  according to the Department of Homeland Security There was no law requiring the separation of families  and Trump was not preventing kids from going to jail by ordering it  as the Lid story suggested The Juvenile Referral Process Obamas Juvenile Referral Process operated from May 2014 to September 2015 as a pilot program meant to combat smuggling The program was the brainchild of former Border Patrol agent Robert Harris  whose intelligence analysts estimated that 78 percent of guides smuggling migrants and drugs into the US were Mexicans younger than 18 Mexican drug cartels often hire or conscript teenagers to smuggle people and drugs across the border because teenagers are not prosecuted if caught Under laws governing treatment of unaccompanied alien children  minors from Mexico and Canada can be immediately sent back to their country Sometimes they are deported by bus the same day they are apprehended Minors from other nations  by contrast  must be transferred within 72 hours to the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement and placed in the least restrictive setting possible until they can be flown home Mexican teenagers smuggling on behalf of drug cartels are known as circuit children  and Harris told the Washington Post that several were caught and released multiple times before the Juvenile Referral Process  which was designed to deter repeat crossings In short  Mexican children suspected of smuggling drugs were held by the US government rather than immediately being sent home It was used for unaccompanied Mexican minors who had multiple apprehensions   up to 30 a year in a few cases   and thus were thought to be working on behalf of human and drug smuggling organizations  said Randy Capps  director of research for US programs at the Migration Policy Institute The pilot progam also was established to create some type of consequence for children involved in smuggling  as they are usually just returned to Mexico and often cross again  said Maureen Meyer  director for Mexico and migrant rights at the Washington Office on Latin America Under the program  Border Patrol worked with the federal prosecutors to determine whether to criminally prosecute a repeat border crosser suspected of smuggling Those not selected for prosecution were referred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement like minors from non contiguous countries instead of being deported While detained   sometimes for months   and awaiting the chance to appear before an immigration court  minors under the Juvenile Referral Process faced questioning from US authorities about their affiliations Most minors who completed the program were eventually deported after seeing an immigration judge  according to a 2015 report from the Washington Office on Latin America Denise Gilman  a law professor who directs the immigration clinic at the University of Texas School of Law  said conditions under the Juvenile Referral Process were not great It was a small pilot program for sure  although the detention facilities were certainly problematic and the length of detention uncertain  she said Gilman noted that other facilities in Karnes City and Dilley  Texas  which the Obama administration used as licensed childcare facilities to detain families seeking asylum  did resemble internment camps She said this practice was carefully circumscribed by the end of the Obama administration as a result of legal challenges But those facilities were separate from the process created under the Juvenile Referral Process  which handled only unaccompanied circuit children and placed them in the same Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities used for unaccompanied minors from non contiguous countries According to the Office of Refugee Resettlement website   these facilities are state licensed and provide a range of care   including foster care  group homes  shelter  staff secure  secure and residential treatment centers   and they offer classroom education  health care  socialization and recreation opportunities  mental health services  legal services and case management Meyer said these children were usually placed in the  secure juvenile detention centers that are more restrictive because of their criminal activities I never heard of any Mexican child in adetention camp  she said Still  human rights advocates objected to the Juvenile Referral Program as an intelligence gathering enterprise that could jeopardize minors post deportation security Violent drug cartels often retaliate against members suspected of talking with law enforcement by taking action against them or their families,0,0,1115,fake
2205,2010-08-10T11:47:44-04:00,2010,abcnewsgocom,Gen Peter Chiarelli,About 106 000 soldiers had a prescription of three weeks or more for pain  depression or anxiety medication,Leaders of the US Army need to take more active steps to prevent a growing number of soldiers from committing suicide  according to a major study released by the Army Gen Peter Chiarelli discussed the study on This Week with Christiane Amanpour The study documented complex pressures    including overly long deployments  more tolerance for high risk behavior among soldiers and lax standards for leaders keeping tabs on their soldiers Another complicating factor  increased use of prescription antidepressants  anti anxiety drugs and pain medications We know that we had over 106 000 soldiers last year who had a prescription of three weeks or more for some kind of antidepressant  anti anxiety medicine  said Chiarelli A few moments later  he added  A portion of those 106 000 soldiers that I told you are on some kind of pain medication  it has nothing to do with a behavior health issue There are soldiers who have been on two  three  four deployments  hucking a rucksack filled with equipment that may weigh 70 to 80 pounds at 8 000 feet  and theyve got a knee injury or a leg injury that is painful Probably should stay home and get operated on  but they go back for the second deployment  and theyre on some kind of a pain medication We have soldiers who suck it up all the time and hide from their leaders when theyre hurt Chiarelli was referring to information in the Armys Health Promotion  Risk Reduction  and Suicide Prevention Report   released Aug 5  2010 This seemed like an important issue to explore further The report explains that historically  the Armys suicide rate has been much lower than the civilian populations But the Armys rate began increasing in 2004 and surpassed the national average in 2008 That year  the suicide rate in the Army was 202 per 100 000  compared with a typical civilian rate of 192 This increase prompted the study In Fiscal Year  FY  2009  160 active duty Soldiers took their lives  making suicide the third leading cause of death among the Army population  the study states If we include accidental death  which frequently is the result of high risk behavior  drinking and driving  drug overdose  etc   we find that less young men and women die in combat than die by their own actions Simply stated  we are often more dangerous to ourselves than the enemy The report affirms the 106 000 number that Chiarelli uses Latest accounts estimate that approximately 106 000 Soldiers are prescribed some form of pain  depression or anxiety medications The potential for abuse is obvious  it states The report also discusses whether these and other prescription drugs are being abused by members of the military  There is concern that potential prescription drug abuse is masked in our current system This is the result of the increase in prescriptions which expands the population authorized to use pharmaceuticals For example  the growing population who has obtained prescriptions for amphetamines has resulted in an increased rate of authorized use Unfortunately  there is no definitive method to ascertain if the use was authorized or illicit As a result  we have masked a subset of that population who are either dependent or illicitly use drugs Ultimately  if left unchecked  this gap facilitates a population of drug addicts and distributors The report also notes that many soldiers are aged 18 to 29  and there are continuing questions about the use of antidepressants    specifically  Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors  SSRIs     among young people  and whether these medications sometimes increas e the risk of suicide The Army Medical Command  MEDCOM  is cognizant of this issue and is investigating the use of these and other medications to better manage care  the report states The report makes additional observations about prescription drug users in the military Pain medications seem to be more common than antidepressants or anti anxiety drugs  14  of the force is taking some form of opiate medication  according to the report  The percentage for antidepressants and anti anxiety medications appear somewhat lower  with between 3 and 6 percent of the deployed force receiving such medication  according to evidence the report cites Anecdotal evidence in the report indicates some soldiers receive multiple prescriptions for pain and depression We should emphasize the study draws no hard conclusions about the role that prescription drugs play in military suicides The impact of increased use of antidepressant  psychiatric and narcotic pain management medications has not been comprehensively studied in a military population  the report states In the interview with Amanpour  Chiarelli rejected the idea that soldiers were overly medicated We know that the drugs that were talking about are cleared by the CENTCOM surgeon for soldiers to be taking when theyre downrange So were not sending any soldier into harms way who is taking a drug that we feel would somehow endanger him or others  he said Finally  we should note that the report links policing potential drug addiction to military leadership in a section titled The Lost Art of Leadership in Garrison The Army has been transformed in recent years  the report states  so that combat readiness has been emphasized more than good order and discipline practices Unannounced health and welfare checks and inspections have been lost as part of that transition There are instances where a leaders lack of Soldier accountability resulted in suicide victims not being found until they had been dead for three or four weeks  the report noted While the report raises a host of issues  were only ruling on what the general said about the rate of medication among soldiers The Army report and other testimony that we found support Chiarellis statement that approximately 106 000 soldiers had a prescription of three weeks or more for pain  depression or anxiety medication,0,0,957,real

With all the hand wringing over the proposal for an Islamic cultural center with a mosque just two blocks away from Ground Zero  we wondered whether Bloomberg was right that there is already a mosque just four blocks away from the World Trade Center site In short  yes The mosque Bloomberg is referring to is Masjid Manhattan  which is located in the basement floor of a building at 20 Warren Street And its four blocks from the World Trade Center Masjid Manhattan has been a fixture of the Lower Manhattan neighborhood since 1970 According to its website  hundreds gather there daily for five Congregational Salahs and more than 1 000 regularly attend Congregational Friday Sermons The home page of the mosques website currently carries the following disclaimer  Please be advised that we are by no means affiliated with any other organization trying to build anything new in the area of downtown Manhattan Since 1970  Masjid Manhattan has been a peaceful  not for profit organization located in the area of downtown Manhattan Our members are City  State and Federal employees  as well as professional employees of the Financial area who come to our Masjid to perform their daily prayers Masjid Manhattan and its members condemn any type of terrorist acts In particular  the attacks of 9 11 where non Muslims as well as Muslims lost their lives Islam always invites for peace  therefore Islam is not responsible for the actions of some ill individuals who  independently from what Islam advocates  have hatred against humanity As Muslims and as Americans  we will never forget the beloved ones who perished that terrible day of September 11  2001 For some perspective on the relative distances between Ground Zero  the proposed mosque and the existing Masjid Manhattan  we direct you to the Washington Posts interactive online map showing the location of all three sites  Theres also a mosque 12 blocks from Ground Zero  Masjid al Farah  where Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf has been a longtime prayer leader Rauf is one of the principals behind the plan for the cultural center and mosque proposal at 45 51 and 49 51 Park Place  two blocks north of the northern edge of the World Trade Center site While Masjid Manhattan is conservative and Masjid al Farah more progressive  a New York Times profile of the two mosques notes that both are essentially one room operations And they share another similarity  the story notes  both routinely turn people away for lack of space In fact  due to the spillover from Masjid al Farah  Rauf has been leading prayer services since 2009 in one of the buildings at the heart of the controversy Plans for the new property are much more ambitious than the settings of the existing mosques  calling for a  100 million  15 story community center with a swimming pool  gym and basketball court  a 500 seat auditorium  a restaurant and culinary school  exhibitions  education programs  a library  reading room  art studios  childcare services and a September 11 memorial The plans also include a mosque that the sites organizers estimated could attract as many as 2 000 worshippers on Fridays  according to the Washington Post  Again  in making his argument against a no mosque zone around the World Trade Center  Bloomberg said theres already a mosque four blocks away from Ground Zero Hes right,1,0,682,real

Its expected to be  11 trillion  according to the nonpartisan researchers at the Congressional Budget Office in an August 2012 report  The estimate marks the fourth year in a row with a deficit of more than  1 trillion  the CBO noted  although the projection is down slightly from the  12 trillion deficit that CBO projected in March This years deficit will be three quarters as large as the deficit in 2009 when measured relative to the size of the economy  the report noted So the deficit is shrinking  but its nowhere near half the level from 2009 PolitiFact Florida previously asked the Obama campaign about the pledge The campaign pointed us to Obamas response when asked about it by an Atlanta TV station in February 2012 Well  were not there because this recession turned out to be a lot deeper than any of us realized  he said Everybody who is out there back in 2009  if you look back at what their estimates were in terms of how many jobs had been lost  how bad the economy had contracted when I took office  everybody underestimated it ,1,0,447,real

Anyone? the Great Depression  passed the Anyone? Anyone? The tariff bill? The Hawley Smoot Tariff Act? Which  anyone? Raised or lowered? raised tariffs  in an effort to collect more revenue for the federal government Did it work? Anyone? Anyone know the effects? It did not work  and the United States sank deeper into the Great Depression Steins monologue pretty much tracks with what Clinton said  The United States imposed tariffs  they backfired  and the Depression got even worse Specifically  the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act of 1930    sponsored by Sen Reid Smoot  R Utah  and Rep Willis Hawley  R Ore    raised tariffs on manufactured foreign imports to 40 percent in some cases  the highest in US history It also extended tariff protection to some agricultural products These moves  in turn  led other countries to retaliate with high tariffs of their own So how accurate is the Clinton Stein version of events? Several economists and historians who studied the period said that its quite accurate Expert opinions Douglas Irwin  a Dartmouth College economist and author of Peddling Protectionism  Smoot Hawley and the Great Depression and Trade Policy Disaster  Lessons from the 1930s  said Clinton was astute in distinguishing between putting the brakes on future expansion of free trade  as Trump and Clinton have both at times advocated  and actually reversing established trade agreements by imposing new tariffs  as only Trump has suggested Protectionism did not cause the Great Depression  but I think saying it made it longer and more painful is actually quite well put  Irwin said Irwin said there was no real reason to impose such tariffs  and that it was mainly done for domestic political reasons In fact  President Herbert Hoover is said to have signed the law only reluctantly  over the spirited objections of many economists After the tariffs were enacted  other countries  including Canada  retaliated against the United States by establishing a preferential trade bloc with Great Britain and other countries  thus hurting US exports Other countries also used trade restrictions and protectionism as beggar thy neighbor policies to help their domestic economies during the worldwide slump  Irwin said The problem  Irwin said  was that if every country tries this strategy  everyone worse off since one countrys imports are another countrys exports World trade reduced significantly  and since trade barriers are easy to impose and hard to relax  the problem festered for some time Indeed  it took until 1933 for this downward spiral to ease Thats when President Franklin D Roosevelt    a committed opponent of the Smoot Hawley tariffs    took office Roosevelt came in on the traditional Democratic platform that tariffs should fall  and his Secretary of State  Cordell Hull  was practically a one issue man on the subject of freeing up trade  said Eric Rauchway  a historian at the University of California Davis and author of The Money Makers  How Roosevelt and Keynes Ended the Depression  Defeated Fascism  and Secured a Prosperous Peace The Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act of 1934 started the US down that road  giving the executive power to negotiate agreements on tariffs Hull used this power to bring down trade barriers As a side effect  the skirmishes over trade also frayed relations between former allies and may have contributed to the tensions that led to World War II  or at the very least complicated the Allies efforts to respond to the threat from Germany and Japan This isnt to say that there is unanimity among scholars about the precise role of Smoot Hawley in worsening the Great Depression Economists today debate the tariffs effect on the Great Depression    some feel it substantially worsened the downturn  while others think its negative effect was small  said Andrew Wender Cohen  a Syracuse University historian and author of Contraband  Smuggling and the Birth of the American Century For instance  Robert S McElvaine  a Millsaps College historian and author of The Great Depression  America 1929 1941  said the spotlighting of Smoot Hawley has been articulated most aggressively by conservative  free market advocates because it takes the focus off 1920s era tax cuts and general income inequality during that decade Still  McElvaine agreed that  even if the tariffs werent the biggest factor for prolonging the Great Depression    he points instead to insufficiently effective New Deal policies under Roosevelt    the tariffs did have an effect  and it was clearly negative Its also tricky to isolate causes of economic turmoil because they were tightly interwoven  experts said Its entirely possible that international trade would have dwindled even if government had not resorted to protectionism  said John E Moser  an Ashland University historian and author of Global Great Depression and the Coming of World War II However  most economists agree that protectionism at the very least did not help  and likely prolonged the Depression Alonzo L Hamby  an Ohio University historian and author of For the Survival of Democracy  Franklin Roosevelt and the World Crisis of the 1930s  agreed I think Clinton has a strong case for the proposition that it hurt an economy that already had moved into a deep recession  Hamby said,12,0,1129,real

states red flag law has led to numerous false reports on right wing websites that police arbitrarily took away a mans Second Amendment rights Seattle police begin gun confiscations  no laws broken  no warrant  no charges  stated a March 7 headline on Liberty Headlines  The story was attributed to Zero Hedge   which used a story from the website SHTFplan that claimed that Seattle police used Nazi style gun confiscation The same or similar stories have appeared on many right leaning websites  The Liberty Headlines story said that police seized the mans gun after neighbors had complained the man had been staring at people through storefront windows while wearing a holstered firearm Other residents complained that the mans open carrying made them feel uncomfortable and unsafe The story declared tyranny has officially taken hold on American soil and that a citizens Second Amendment rights have been ripped away from him by the government Sounds alarming But its not accurate Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated  as part of the social networks efforts to combat online hoaxes We found that the headline was wrong and that the story failed to explain that police obtained a warrant from a judge after the 31 year old man failed to turn over his gun and appear at a hearing  as ordered by the court  Red Flag laws in Washington and other states In 2016  Washington state voters overwhelmingly approved Initiative 1491 to allow courts  upon petition by police or a family or household member  to issue an extreme risk protection order The order prevents an individual from accessing firearms for a specified time period if the court determines the person poses a significant danger A handful of other states  including California  have similar red flag laws  and many other states are considering passing them Following the Parkland shooting  Florida passed such a law to allow law enforcement to seek a risk protection order While the NRA argues the laws violate a persons rights by taking away a gun when no crime has been committed  law enforcement argues it is a tool they can use to take away a gun before a catastrophe occurs Details about the Seattle police seizing a mans handgun PolitiFact interviewed Sgt Eric Pisconski  who heads up the unit that oversees extreme risk protection orders  as well as Seattle police spokesman Det Patrick Michaud Police did not released the suspects name PolitiFact submitted records requests to the King County prosecutor and obtained the criminal complaint that explains the charge against Alexander Sinclair McKenzie  an Army veteran with post traumatic stress disorder Police said they had received multiple calls about McKenzies escalating behavior in the past year McKenzie voluntarily surrendered a gun in 2017 after he was served with an anti harassment order  even though he wasnt required to do so He acknowledged he was experiencing stress and did not want the gun around  Michaud said Months later  McKenzie  who lives above a restaurant  had several interactions with the restaurant staff In one instance  he stood in front of the restaurant and yelled obscenities and accused people of talking to him through the floor No crimes were committed at that time  but his behavior was erratic and unnerving to all  resulting in contact by police  Michaud said McKenzie declined services  but shortly thereafter he called police again to report taunting and voices coming from the restaurant below through the floor He also told police that he was armed with a gun and wanted a female employee arrested or shot by police  Michaud said McKenzie was ultimately taken to a medical facility On Feb 13  police petitioned the court to get an extreme risk protection order to take away McKenzies gun A King County Superior Court Judge approved the order and police served it to McKenzie in person at a medical facility He agreed to call police when he was discharged to hand over the firearm After he left the medical facility on Feb 23  police attempted to contact McKenzie multiple times to obtain his firearm After McKenzie didnt show up for his Feb 27 court date about the order to turn over his gun  the judge granted a search warrant based on probable cause to arrest McKenzie was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm by a person prohibited by extreme risk protection order  a gross misdemeanor On March 1  police went to McKenzies apartment and took his gun He was placed into custody and booked at the King County jail The case remains pending Pisconski said that since the law went into effect in 2017  Seattle police have received 16 extreme risk protection orders that resulted in collecting about 26 guns This was the only case in which the suspect didnt voluntarily surrender a gun One of the websites that wrote that police took the gun without a warrant added an editors note about errors in its original article The SHFTplan website  which has the tagline when it hits the fan  dont say we didnt warn you  updated the article to state that law enforcement did have a warrant,0,0,858,fake

In a word  Yes Weve explored their similarities before in previous fact checks  when liberals have made similar statements defending the Obama plan against critics who labeled it extreme Well review the two plans similarities again here   Individual mandate to buy health insurance Everyone in Massachusetts must purchase health insurance or else pay a penalty  the same goes for the federal plan  though the penalty structures vary between the two   Employer responsibilities for offering health insurance Companies with more than 10 employees in Massachusetts need to offer health insurance or else pay a penalty The federal law sets the bar for companies at 50 employees  though technically the bill isnt quite a mandate Instead  employers pay fines only if their workers qualify for tax credits to buy insurance   Health insurance exchanges Both the Massachusetts and national plans involve the use of voluntary exchanges that individuals and small businesses can use to purchase private sector health insurance These exchanges are designed to offer a range of plans with different benefits and premium levels   Affordability subsidies Under both plans  lower income individuals and families can receive government subsidies to help them pay their health insurance premiums In the Massachusetts plan  subsidies are allotted on a sliding scale up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level Under the national plan  the sliding scale subsidies go up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level   Expansion of Medicaid The Massachusetts plan expands Medicaid to all children up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level The federal plan also expands Medicaid  but in a different fashion  offering it to all individuals  not just children  up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level   Insurance market regulation Both plans restructure the insurance market  in similar but slightly different ways They handle the individual and small group markets differently In Massachusetts  dependents up to age 25 can be covered on their parents plan  while the federal law allows such dependent coverage up to age 26 Still  there are some differences between the federal law and the Massachusetts law Two of the biggest differences    Cost containment Critics of the Massachusetts plan have taken it to task for its lack of cost containment provisions The federal law makes changes to Medicare that are intended to lower program costs  such as restructuring how payments are made to Medicare Advantage plans    the HMO option under Medicare Since Medicare is a federal program  the Massachusetts plan does not address this issue   Financing Both the Massachusetts plan and federal law are financed in part by revenue generated from the individual and employer mandates But the Massachusetts plans financing is heavily dependent on leveraging federal matching funds  while the federal law  in addition to cost savings from Medicare  imposes taxes on drugmakers  device manufacturers  health insurers and indoor tanning services It also taxes high cost  Cadillac  health care plans The Massachusetts plan does not do any of these things We should note that the plans are so similar  we made a quiz  selecting passages from each plan to see if our readers could tell the difference   Take the quiz yourself!   Pawlenty said that Obamacare was patterned after Mitts plan in Massachusetts In rating that statement  we noticed that Pawlenty phrased his statement carefully He didnt say it was the same plan  but instead said that the national law was patterned after the Massachusetts law  and they had substantial similarities Hes correct that the plans  thought not completely identical  are very similar in structure They both require everyone to have health insurance or pay a penalty  they both leave the current insurance system in place  they both expand coverage for the uninsured through subsidies or Medicaid,1,1,765,real

Once seniors began to enroll  problems persisted According to the report  the online tools had accuracy problems  and local organizations designated with assisting seniors reported problems getting necessary and accurate information Call centers provided by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services underestimated the needed capacity to ensure that reliable answers could be provided and service representatives were not knowledgeable or failed to provide accurate information The Georgetown experts anticipated similar hiccups with the Affordable Care Act  noting that the countrys experience with Medicare Part D suggested the experience will be far from perfect and problems were not always addressed as quickly or as thoroughly as critics would have liked  but fixes were usually found These days  nine in 10 seniors who utilize the program report they are satisfied with it Theres really a striking amount of similarity even though this time its a far larger and daunting task Its a fair comparison  said Jack Hoadley at the Georgetown Universitys Health Policy Institute and one of the authors of the study Once something works its way through the problems  you forget the problems Still different But there are important differences between Medicare Part D and the Affordable Care Act that make the challenges facing the exchanges different Because it was aimed at seniors and e commerce was still relatively young  Medicaregov was not intended to be the main hub for people to purchase and review plans  said David Brailer  the first National Coordinator for Health Information Technology under Bush The issue with Medicare Part D is there were choices of 70 to 100 plans  Brailer said People were overwhelmed with the choices  with the options available and didnt know how to navigate and pick one I dont remember a conversation at all blaming any IT people This was about how do you really navigate through all these choices Meanwhile  most people who logged on to healthcaregov in the opening weeks couldnt even get far enough to review what options were available Also  prescription drugs are a relatively small and easy to understand part of health care Shopping for an insurance plan is more complicated For those who did choose to enroll  in Medicare Part D  online  they checked out their options by typing in drugs they used  and once you did  you got an estimated out of pocket cost to make your comparisons In the exchange world you have a full health care benefit to buy  Hoadley said The drug cost is relatively predictable  certainly a lot more predictable than overall health costs The challenge for this website is a lot greater  probably by a significant amount of magnitude And theres the political climate as well When Medicare Part D passed  Democrats were not happy with the final bill and were critical of its botched rollout But even then  they were generally supportive of its intended outcome and worked with constituents who had difficulty signing up or utilizing their new benefits When Medicare Part D faced early troubles  many blue states came to its rescue The New York Times reported in 2006 that about 20 states  including California  Illinois  Ohio  Pennsylvania and all of New England  have announced that they will help low income people by paying drug claims that should have been paid by the federal Medicare program By contrast  not a single Republican voted for the Affordable Care Act  and in the years since it passed  the party has made its repeal a top priority In the states  many Republican governors have bucked the Medicaid expansion and rejected offers to build their own insurance marketplaces  putting greater pressure on the federal government Henry Aaron  a health policy expert at the Brookings Institute  said the opposition from Republicans has forced the Obama administration into a two front war Bush did not have to fight On the one hand  one must and should address the administrative problems that no one denies is plaguing the problem  he said But youre also waging a war of public opinion against the hysterics of its critics,5,1,1190,real

Republicans 24 million  Democrats 42  million  In the packed convention hall  it was one of the nights biggest applause lines In 2010  we checked a similar claim from Rep Carolyn Maloney  D NY  who said that Democratic presidents have been considerably more effective at creating private sector jobs After crunching the numbers back to President Harry Truman  we found that jobs did indeed grow faster under Democratic presidents when adjusted for a presidents years served in office So we rated the claim True  Clintons claim at the convention was worded differently  so we quickly re crunched the numbers based on his specifications Lets cut to the chase According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  here are the net increases in private sector employment under each president  chronologically by party  Republicans Richard Nixon  Increase of 71 million jobs Gerald Ford  Increase of 13 million jobs Ronald Reagan  Increase of 147 million jobs George HW Bush  Increase of 15 million jobs George W Bush  Decline of 646 000 jobs Total  Increase of 239 million jobs under Republican presidents Democrats John F Kennedy  Increase of 27 million jobs Lyndon B Johnson  Increase of 95 million jobs Jimmy Carter  Increase of 90 million jobs Bill Clinton  Increase of 208 million jobs Barack Obama  Increase of 332 000 jobs Total  Increase of 423 million jobs So Clinton is right But well bring up a few points worth noting This does not include government jobs The combination of private sector jobs and public sector jobs is a broader measurement of job creation than private sector alone But excluding government jobs would presumably hurt Democrats more than Republicans  given the two parties historical stances toward the role of government The fact that Democrats finished so far ahead despite taking government jobs off the table makes it a more impressive accomplishment The Democrats didnt benefit from population growth For our previous story  Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless calculated that the US working age population actually grew slightly faster under Republican presidents  also making the Democratic accomplishment more impressive Presidents deserves less credit for the good times and less blame for the bad times Its a truism of politics that when things go well  the president generally gets too much credit  and when things dont go well  the president usually gets too much blame Shouldnt the Republican Congress of 1995 2001 get a share of the credit for Clintons robust job growth? Shouldnt the Democratic House that served under Reagan? Most experts would say yes and yes Since we published our previous story  we have changed our policy  We now factor into our ratings whether the politician or party deserves credit or blame for the statistical trend being analyzed In this item  though  we will not factor in credit or blame  because both parties have had presidents serve during the time we looked at  meaning that both parties would have benefited and suffered in roughly equal proportions Its unclear how much this finding says about our political and economic systems Job creation for each president depended to a certain extent on timing  external factors and luck And as Yale political scientist David Mayhew pointed out for our previous story  conclusions drawn from a relatively narrow data set    in this case  just 12 postwar presidencies    need to be taken with a grain of salt,4,0,620,real

Theres a lot to unpack there Lets start with the hicky charge before moving onto our fact check The hicky incident arose from an attack ad against Manchin that the National Republican Senatorial Committee put together The ad shows three men in a diner talking about how they dont want to vote for Manchin because he would support President Barack Obama The men are wearing flannel shirts and trucker hats  but other than that  it seems like a straightforward man on the street type of ad The controversy came when Politico reported on the advertisement looking for actors in Philadelphia to portray the men at the diner We are going for a Hicky Blue Collar look  read the casting call for the ad These characters are from West Virginia so think coal miner trucker looks Clothing Suggestions included jeans  work boots  flannel shirt  denim shirt  Dickies type jacket with t shirt underneath  down filled vest  John Deer  sic  hats  not brand new  preferably beat up   trucker hats  not brand new  preferably beat up   according to Politico Several days after those descriptions came to light  the NRSC fired the firm that was responsible We werent as interested in the hicky controversy as we were in the claims about Raeses Florida connections We asked the Raese campaign for a response  but we didnt hear back So we started by checking the voter registration rolls in Florida  which are public records We quickly determined that Raeses wife  Elizabeth Raese  is registered to vote in Palm Beach County She has been registered since 2001 and last voted in the 2008 election  according to the Palm Beach County Supervisor of elections We also cross checked her address with the Palm Beach County Property Appraiser Property records indicate Elizabeth and John Raese own a 6 934 square foot home purchased in 1999 and with a market value of  267 million The 2010 record also shows that the Raeses receive a homestead exemption  which indicates that the home is an owners primary residence We spoke with officials at the Palm Beach County Property Appraisers office They confirmed that the Raeses did qualify for the exemption for the 2010 tax year  and that Elizabeth Raese is registered to vote in Florida and holds a Florida drivers license John Raese is listed as owner non resident in the appraisers records The officials confirmed that its possible for a married couple to jointly own property and claim an exemption when only one spouse is the Florida homeowner It might seem strange to have a spouse who is an official resident of a state different from your own  but the Raeses wealth may account for the arrangement Raeses campaign biography states  Despite a long list of business accomplishments throughout a lifetime  John is most proud of his family   wife Liz and two wonderful daughters Jane and Agnes Liz is the founder of the Conservative Women of West Virginia  a growing group of activists charting a conservative path for the Mountain State  Press reports indicate his children attend a private Christian school in Florida  The ad further states that Raese moved his family to Florida to avoid paying West Virginia taxes Florida does not have a personal income tax and West Virginia does  but this claim is impossible for us to check  Tax information is confidential unless a candidate chooses to release it Raese hasnt done that But a campaign spokesman told the Charleston Gazette that Raese does pay taxes in West Virginia John Raese is a West Virginia resident Period He pays income and property taxes there  and any attempts to claim otherwise are acts of desperation by a hopelessly listing campaign  said spokesman Kevin McLaughlin The Gazette also reported that Raese owns a home in Morgantown  W Va  listed on the National Register of Historic Places  and that he is registered to vote in Monongalia County Raese has run for office before and had his residency questioned by opponents But Raeses campaign biography and independent press reports indicate that he is a longtime West Virginia resident He serves as president and CEO of Greer Industries  a steel and limestone company founded by his grandparents and headquartered in Morgantown  W Va Manchins ad tries to make voters question Raeses loyalty to West Virginia Its hard to make a case that Raese isnt someone with longtime ties to West Virginia On the other hand  its true that his wife is registered to vote in Florida  and thats the fact were checking here Public records confirm she is registered to vote in Florida and receives a homestead exemption on her property,1,0,916,real

Because it turns out  it wasnt the Russians Contrary to Gingrichs statement  the thin case that Rich was the DNC leaker is in no way substantial enough to outweigh ample evidence that Russia was the culprit Two days after Gingrich made this claim  Fox News retracted its report promoting this conspiracy theory Scant evidence that Seth Rich leaked the emails The latest iteration of this story started when Wheeler spoke to a reporter with Washington local news station WWTG TV on May 15 Wheeler worked for the Washington police in the 1990s and is an occasional Fox News contributor Texas businessman Ed Butowsky  another Fox News contributor  is financing Wheelers investigation Wheeler told WWTG TV he believes the local police and the FBI are engaged in a cover up because of information found on Richs laptop and the relationship between the Washington mayors office and the DNC But you have sources at the FBI saying there is information that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks? asked the WTTG TV reporter Absolutely  Wheeler replied Yeah  and thats confirmed The next day  a national Fox News report said an unnamed federal investigator corroborated Wheelers findings And according to the federal investigator  an FBI analysis of Richs laptop found that Rich made contact with a WikiLeaks director and sent him 44 053 emails and 17 761 attachments from DNC leaders Heres the problem  Hours after Fox published its report  Wheeler recanted He told CNN that he hadnt seen the evidence himself  and his knowledge of Richs alleged email contact with WikiLeaks came from the national Fox News reporter  not his own investigative work Let me just really quickly say this  Wheeler said on Hannity s show May 16 I dont know for sure  I dont know as a matter of fact if the emails went out to the WikiLeaks or anybody else  but it sure appears that way Fox retracted its own May 16 article  saying the article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting So this allegation that Rich was the real DNC leaker   and related insinuation that Rich was murdered because of it   rests nearly entirely on claims from a single unnamed federal investigator with unspecified connections to the case The theory also doesnt make much logical sense No evidence has emerged that shows Rich was so disgruntled with the DNC that he felt the need to expose its leaders to WikiLeaks Further  the leaked emails were overall rather mild They were embarrassing and prompted Rep Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida to step down from her role as DNC chair  but they didnt expose any conspiracies or illegal activity All of this together makes for a pretty flimsy case  especially when compared to the broad consensus that Russian actors were the true culprit Lots of evidence Russia stole  then leaked  the emails The intelligence community and private cybersecurity professionals have widely concluded that the DNC hack and WikiLeaks dump are covered in Russian fingerprints The technical methods behind the hack were similar to those used by two Russian intelligence groups  dubbed APT28 and APT29  also known as Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear And experts have said that dumping large quantities of stolen political information is a signature move of Russian influence operations Theres also the fact that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and the Russian government have a well documented relationship Assange has hosted a television show on RT  a state owned network  for example Various intelligence agencies reiterated Russias culpability in official reports in October   December and January  And intelligence community leaders and experts in Russia and cybersecurity have said they agreed with this conclusion in testimony before Congress in the months since The final piece of Russias modern Active Measures surfaced in the summer of 2016 as hacked materials were strategically leaked  said Clint Watts  senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and former FBI special agent  in a March 30 Senate hearing  The disclosures of WikiLeaks  Guccifer 20 and DC Leaks demonstrated how hacks would power the influence system Russia had built so successfully in the previous two years Theres evidence that Russia engaged in cyber operations against Republicans  too  though it wasnt as robust as the DNC hack The Russians used cyber operations against both political parties  including hacking into servers used by the Democratic National Committee and releasing stolen data to WikiLeaks and other media outlets  said former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper in a May hearing  Russia also collected on certain Republican Party affiliated targets  but did not release any Republican related data,2,0,1049,fake

We looked into Bidens claim to find out First we contacted Bidens staff to find out which figures they were using to come to the  2 100 decrease in the median income for middle class households Tobin Marcus  Bidens deputy economic policy adviser  told us the vice president was referring to real median household income for working age households Were looking at the core wage earning households as opposed to retirees  Marcus said Working age households are typically considered houses headed by someone between the ages of 25 and 54  and the median income was chosen to represent middle income wage earners Bidens office cited the Census Bureaus Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Surveys for year ending data for 2000 and 2007  They said they compared inflation adjusted numbers  using the annual average increase column of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index  We took a look at their numbers  and their calculations checked out To be sure  we contacted Dennis Delay  an economist with the New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies and a New Hampshire State Forecast Manager for the New England Economic Partnership He confirmed the calculations Bidens campaign provided I looked at the data sources  and they appear to be correct  and the data calculated correctly  Delay said Delay then pointed us to a report by the Economic Policy Institute which used the same data From 2000 07  the Institute said the real median income of working age households fell from  61 574 in 2000 to  59 460 in 2007 a decrease of  2 114 The White House Task Force on the Middle Class cited a weak labor market and anemic job growth of the 2000s among some of the problems that contributed to the approximately 34 percent decline in the median of middle class incomes over the seven years leading up to the economic recession Clearly median inflation adjusted income fell much faster during the recession  2007 to present   Delay said But the fall in that indicator during a period of economic expansion  2000 to 2007  is very troubling I dont believe any other period of economic expansion saw a commensurate decline in median inflation adjusted income,1,0,504,real

Yes Though there is some disagreement Let us explain In preparing to deploy the scanners to airports across the country  the TSA studied the amount of radiation a person would be exposed to per scan to determine if the machines were safe Scientists at The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory found that the effective dose per screening was 158 microrems of radiation   while a researcher at the National Institute of Standards and Technology  an agency of the US Department of Commerce  said an adult would be exposed to 24 microrems of radiation per scan  We understand those figures mean nothing to most people So lets put it into perspective A single chest X ray exposes a person to between 8 000 and 10 000 microrems  or 8 to 10 millirems   according to experts at Princeton University and the Department of Energy A pack a day smoker exposes himself to 15 000 to 20 000 microrems of radiation a year  tobacco leaves used in making cigarettes contain radioactive lead and polonium  Put simply  it would take at least 3 300 body scans to reach the equivalent of one chest X ray Whats also important to note    and a bit scary    is that youre being exposed to radiation right now Radiation is naturally occurring in our environment no matter where you are The Nuclear Regulatory Commission estimates that each year  the average adult is exposed to 300 millirems of naturally occurring radiation  300 000 microrems  and 60 millirems  60 000 microrems  of man made radiation Pistole  in his claim  is talking about naturally occurring cosmic radiation youre exposed to during airplane travel The amount of cosmic radiation a person is exposed to varies based on a number of factors  but to oversimplify  a key component is how high you are above sea level People living in Denver  which is 1 mile above sea level  are exposed to more cosmic radiation than someone living in Florida And people flying 30 000 feet in the air are exposed to more radiation than people on the ground The amount of radiation varies depending upon the specific flight plan  but the Environmental Protection Agency  the World Health Organization and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission all say that a person on a six  to eight hour flight will be exposed to somewhere around 2 000 to 5 000 microrems of radiation For our analysis  however  we are relying on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration   which calculates the radiation exposure per hour based on the altitude of the flight According to NOAA  a person flying at 30 000 feet will be exposed to between 285 and 406 microrems of radiation an hour  or between 475 and 677 microrems per minute of flight All the numbers and science back up Pistoles claim    as little as three minutes of air travel produces the equivalent amount of radiation as one TSA body scan By most estimates  Pistoles claim actually is conservative However  all scientists arent sold on the comparison Nor are they sold on the safety of the scanners We think its important for you hear their side  too Four faculty members at the University of California  San Francisco  authored a letter in April expressing their concerns about the body scanning devices Primarily  the professors worried that the radiation was being concentrated in the skin and underlying tissue  and that it was not being dispersed throughout the entire body That concentration of radiation to the skin could be dangerously high  wrote the faculty members    John Sedat  Marc Shuman  Robert Stroud and David Agard  who said a comparison to cosmic radiation spread over the entire body is misleading The FDA  in a detailed response   said the concerns were unfounded  and health risks associated with the full body scanners were minuscule To be clear  this fact check isnt declaring TSAs new full body scanners safe Were simply looking at the comparative exposure to radiation as suggested by Pistole  who said that the radiation coming from the new TSA body scanners are equivalent to about three minutes worth of air travel by anybody  say  at 30 000 feet It may sound strange  but its right,1,0,887,real

Gregory asked Walker began with a comparison to federal employees Well  our proposal is less restrictive than the federal government is today  Walker said Under Barack Obama  he presides over a federal government where most federal employees do not have collective bargaining for benefits  nor for pay So what were asking for is something less restrictive than what the federal government has Whether Walkers proposal is less restrictive than what the federal government has today is a matter of opinion  and well explain why later   but we were curious whether Walkers was correct that most of the roughly 28 million federal workers do not have collective bargaining rights to negotiate pay and health or pension benefits We turned first to the American Federation of Government Employees  AFGE  which represents 600 000 federal government workers in 65 agencies  including the Department of Defense  Veterans Affairs  Social Security  and the Environmental Protection Agency It is the largest federal employee union Its true  said Beth Moten  legislative and political director for AFGE  that most federal employees dont have collective bargaining rights over pay and benefits So whats the point? Moten asked Should employees in Wisconsin be treated as badly as federal employees are? There are some exceptions to this rule Air traffic controllers  for example  can bargain over wages under a 1996 law that granted full bargaining rights to a number of federal workers covered under the Federal Aviation Administration  said Kate Bronfenbrenner  a labor expert at Cornell University Some also point to the US Postal Service   which has nearly 600 000 career employees  most  but not all  of whom have collective bargaining rights for pay and benefits But theirs is a somewhat different situation Although the US Postal Service reports to Congress  it is an independent agency of the United States government Unlike the private sector  explained US Postal Service spokesman Mark Saunders  postal employees cannot strike  nor can management lock them out Walker said most federal employees And by that measure  he is correct  Bronfenbrenner said Unlike all the other state  county and municipal workers in the country who have collective bargaining rights  federal workers have their pay and benefits set by Congress  Brofenbrenner said But federal workers can bargain over terms and conditions of employment besides pay and benefits This has not created stable labor relations in the public sector by any means  she said Instead it has meant that senators and congressional representatives with large numbers of federal employees in their districts end up fighting to have money put into bills for federal workers in their districts the same as if they were lobbying to get money for a large federal contract Thus  instead of being done in the very open transparent process of state and local public sector bargaining it is all done at a higher level  mostly behind closed doors  but the money still is getting there  just not as equitably as it would if there were collective bargaining Moten  of the American Federation of Government Employees  also stressed that federal employees do have collective bargaining rights over working conditions And thats an important right It affects vacation time  work hours  safety issues    all sorts of things important to workers Under Gov Walkers plan  collective bargaining for state workers would be limited to base pay rate  and raises would generally be limited by the rate of inflation  In a fact check our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin did regarding limiting labor negotiations to only wages  they quoted Candice Owley  president Wisconsin Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals  who said wages are only part of whats important to nurses when they negotiate with hospitals We spend very little time these days on wages and a whole lot of time on working conditions  she said  such as seniority  schedules  the length of shifts  and what happens when a nurse is assigned to a different department Said Owley  We bargain every kind of working condition imaginable Bottom line  negotiations over working conditions are important  and so Walkers larger point    that he is asking for  something less restrictive than what the federal government has    is debatable But in saying that most federal workers dont have collective bargaining rights to benefits and pay  though  Walker is accurate Although there are some federal workers who have collective bargaining rights for benefits and pay  most do not,3,0,754,real
4190,2011-07-27T15:56:19-04:00,2011,wwwcbogov,Barack Obama,The deficit was on track to top  1 trillion the year I took office,In a televised address to the nation on July 25  2011  to discuss the pending deadline on the debt ceiling  President Barack Obama laid out his version of how the deficit situation got to where it is And Obama placed much of the blame at the feet of his predecessor  George W Bush For the last decade  weve spent more money than we take in  Obama said In the year 2000  the government had a budget surplus But instead of using it to pay off our debt  the money was spent on trillions of dollars in new tax cuts  while two wars and an expensive prescription drug program were simply added to our nations credit card As a result  the deficit was on track to top  1 trillion the year I took office Weve dealt with the what Obama inherited question before Obamas suggestion that the deficit woes the country now faces are the result of Bushs tax cuts and an expensive prescription drug program    rather than the recession    is certainly debatable But since many Republicans are blaming the problem on reckless spending by Obama  we decided to check his claim that the deficit was on track to top  1 trillion the year I took office In January  2009  just prior to Obama being sworn in as president  the governments nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office  CBO  released an estimate of the projected deficit for the 2009 fiscal year  which straddled both Bushs and Obamas terms  According to the CBO report   The ongoing turmoil in the housing and financial markets has taken a major toll on the federal budget CBO currently projects that the deficit this year will total  12 trillion  or 83 percent of GDP The CBO cited a number of factors for why the federal fiscal situation would be dramatically worse in 2009 than 2008 According to the CBO  A drop in tax revenues and increased federal spending  much of it related to the governments actions to address the crisis in the housing and financial markets  both contribute to the robust growth in this years deficit Compared with receipts last year  collections from corporate income taxes are anticipated to decline by 27 percent and individual income taxes by 8 percent  in normal economic conditions  they would both grow by several percentage points In addition  the estimated deficit includes outlays of more than  180 billion to reflect the cost of transactions of the TARP In addition  the CBO noted  as a result of the recession  the federal government boosted spending on programs such as those providing unemployment compensation and nutrition assistance Again  this was the deficit projection for 2009 before Obama took office The CBO acknowledged it might get worse That total   12 trillion deficit   however  does not include the effects of any future legislation  the CBO noted Enactment of an economic stimulus package  for example  would add to the 2009 deficit As we know  of course  the Democrat controlled Congress did pass a massive economic stimulus package And  in fact  due in large part to the stimulus  the actual deficit for 2009 ended up about  200 billion more than the CBO projected in January 2009 An April study from the Pew Charitable Trust  found that a combination of factors    increased government spending  tax cuts and the economic downturn    were mostly to blame for the large budget deficits But Dean Baker  a liberal economist and co director of the center for Economic Policy Research  argued in a piece published on the Huffington Post on July 27  2011  that its really the recession  and not any policy decisions from the Bush presidency  that are to blame for the unsustainable deficit projections If the unemployment rate returned to the 47 percent rate of 2007  he wrote  the bulk of the deficit would disappear To lay the budget crisis on Bush tax cuts is misleading  Baker wrote In its budget projections from January 2008  the last set before the impact of the collapse of the housing bubble was clear  the Congressional Budget Office  CBO  projected a deficit of just  198 billion for 2009  Baker wrote This is less than one fifth of the on track to top  1 trillion figure that President Obama gave in his speech This is a serious error Rather  Baker wrote  It was the recession  and the response to it  that pushed the deficit in 2009 from the  198 billion projected by CBO to the over  1 trillion noted by President Obama in his speech No one can justify wasting money on wars that should not have been fought  giving away tax breaks to people who dont need them  or deliberately designing a prescription drug benefit so that it needlessly hands hundreds of billions of dollars to drug companies and insurers  Baker wrote But even with all of this waste  the deficit was still not out of control Were not going to wade into the debate over how much of the deficit to assign to Bush or Obamas policies Obama may be laying too much blame for the deficit crisis on Bush policies  and not enough on the recession But the economic downturn was in full bloom when Obama took office and he is correct that before he enacted any policies as president  the CBO projected a 2009 deficit of  12 trillion  as well as significant projected deficits in years to come as well ,0,0,894,real

presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has presented herself as an advocate for immigrants  saying shell push for immigration reform within her first 100 days in the Oval Office and promising to continue the deferred deportation plans of President Barack Obama On Aug 15   four years to the day since immigration officials began accepting Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals applications   she published a post on Medium directed to those who have applied for the deportation relief program and to those who havent In America  the place of your birth should never be a barrier that stops you from reaching your God given potential     thats what makes our country great  and thats the promise Im going to fight to fulfill  Clinton wrote She said a sizable amount of immigrants could still apply for the program Experts estimate almost half a million people are still eligible  particularly in the Asian American and Pacific Islander community  Clinton wrote We wondered if Clinton was right about the estimated number of eligible applicants  and whether the Asian and Pacific Islander communities represented an outsized proportion Clintons campaign directed us to an August report published by the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute analyzing DACA application rates The study found that application rates were generally very low for immigrants born in Asia DACA background The Homeland Security Department  which oversees immigration enforcement  announced Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals   or DACA  in June 2012 It was designed to defer deportation for undocumented immigrants 30 years old or younger and who arrived in the United States before they were 16 years old Applicants have to meet several criteria to be considered  including having continuously lived in the United States since June 15  2007  and be in school  have graduated or obtained a GED certificate  or be an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or US armed forces Applicants also cannot have felony convictions  a significant misdemeanor or three or more misdemeanors  nor can they be be a threat to national security or public safety Advocates argue that those who were brought to the country by their parents as children should be given opportunities to stay in the country since they likely werent the ones making decisions to migrate or to stay in the country illegally DACA does not grant lawful status  but people who receive DACA are not considered to be unlawfully present during their time of deferred action DACA defers deportation for two year periods  it can be renewed and beneficiaries can also apply for work permits This summer  the Supreme Court deadlocked in a 4 4 decision on an extended version of DACA and on a deferred action program for parents of US citizens and lawful permanent residents  which allowed an appellate courts injunction to stand That decision does not affect the original DACA DACA eligible population Back to Clintons point  We wondered how many unauthorized immigrants are eligible and how many have applied When it comes to the undocumented population  whats usually available are just estimates The Migration Policy Institute report is based on a formula using federal immigration data and Census Bureau survey data The report offers two sets of eligible applicants  13 million and 17 million The institute found that about 13 million unauthorized immigrants were immediately eligible for DACA in 2016    they met all criteria  including high school completion or school enrollment About 400 000 more met DACA criteria except high school completion or school enrollment requirement in 2014 The additional 400 000 may have become eligible for DACA by enrolling in an adult education program   bringing the total eligible population in 2016 to about 17 million  the institute said As of March 31   2016  immigration officials had accepted about 820 000  meaning they can begin going through the deferred action process  Of the nearly 820 000 accepted  officials approved 728 285 So of the 13 million immediately eligible population  about 480 000 can still apply By assuming up to 17 million are eligible  then there could be up to 880 000 who can still apply for DACA Clinton is right that immigrants from the Asian and Pacific Islander population comprise a large chunk of people who can still apply South Korea ranked fourth among the top five countries of birth for the immediately eligible DACA population in 2016  after Mexico  Guatemala and El Salvador   according to the institute Honduras was fifth But only 7 000 of the estimated 49 000 eligible South Koreans have applied And less than 30 percent of about 33 000 eligible immigrants from India and the Philippines have applied Multiple immigration scholars and experts we reached out to cited MPIs research as a credible base for DACA estimates There are more than 130 000 undocumented immigrants of Asian descent eligible for DACA  according to estimates cited by the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders The group also noted back in 2014 that DACA enrollment from Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders was disproportionately low Mexican born immigrants represented 63 percent of the immediately eligible DACA population and 78 percent of them have applied  according to MPI New America Media  a national collaboration of 3 000 ethnic news organizations  reported earlier this month that applications from Asians and Pacific Islanders may be at lower rates because those communities may not know they can apply Some of the reasons they have not applied may include fear of immigration agencies  cultural stigma in speaking about immigration status  shortage of community resources about DACA in languages spoken by Asians and Pacific Islanders  and few portrayals of deportation relief as an issue for their communities  said Sheridan Lagunas  a spokesperson for United We Dream  a youth led immigrant rights national

Cheney Cheney was head of Halliburton When he got to be vice president  when he was signed for vice president  the oil company gave him a  34 million signing bonus to become vice president of the United States Well grant Matthews some artistic license with his comment We know he doesnt mean that Cheney literally got a signing bonus for becoming the vice presidential candidate  as a newly signed free agent would in baseball But we thought it was worth checking whether Cheney did in fact end up with a  34 million payout when he stepped down as CEO to join Bush on the ticket in 2000 We looked at a personal financial disclosure form that Cheney signed on Sept 1  2000 This is the filing made once someone joins a national presidential ticket It represents the candidates holdings and income as of August In the portion addressing Cheneys compensation from Halliburtion  the file lists the following categories and dollar amounts as of that date    Salary bonus  gross    4 721  947   Deferred salary   1 042  441   Senior executive deferred compensation contributions   654 804 Meanwhile  on May 15  2001  Cheney also signed a second disclosure form that is supposed to update the August 2000 filing so that it covers the full year In this filing  Cheney disclosed the following Halliburton income    Salary bonus  gross    821 896   Elective deferred salary   403 166   Stock equivalent unit bonus   396 213   Senior executive deferred compensation contributions   53 692   Elective deferred salary lump sum payout   1 140 160   Restricted stock imputed income   7 560 000   Nonqualified stock option income   21 964 254   Senior executive deferred compensation payout   2 797 128 However  we were unclear about whether the totals from the May 2001 filing  which amount to  351 million  should be added to those from the August 2000 filing  which amount to  64 million  or whether the amounts in the two filings overlap somewhat Experts we spoke to expressed uncertainty on this question as well So we decided to take the most cautious approach and only use the numbers from the second filing  which covers the whole year That still leaves a total of  351 million earned from Halliburtion reported on the May 2001 filing Of that total  just over  800 000 represents salary and bonus  which Cheney would have earned regardless of whether he joined the ticket or not Many of the other categories were subject to some calculation and or negotiation  as would happen in the case of any CEO who left a position early  so it seems fair to call the rest of the income he received an exit package So  if you subtract the salary and bonus from the larger amount  voila    you get  34 million and change So Matthews is right A footnote  Cheneys timing was impeccable As the disclosure forms indicate  he held a large number of stock options  which means he had been given the right to purchase shares of the company for an old  and  hopefully for the holder of the options  lower price than the current market value When the holder chooses to exercise those options  they can buy the shares at the low price and then sell them at the market price  pocketing the difference Its not clear when Cheney sold his stock options  but it likely was within weeks of his being named to the ticket    a period when Halliburtion shares hit their 2000 peak  in the low to mid  50 range By November 30  2000  the stock had fallen to  33 a share If hed waited until then to sell  his payday would have been one third lower  or roughly  14 million rather than  22 million,3,0,762,real

Brennan responded and said no  there is no limitation,When Sen Rand Paul  R Ky  staged his historic filibuster over 13 hours on March 6  2013  he said he just wanted answers He wanted President Barack Obamas administration to definitively say whether the use of armed drones could ever be justified on American soil During his epic stand on the Senate floor  which only ended with the inevitable call of nature  Paul cited several statements made by administration officials that concerned him    including one by CIA Director nominee John Brennan When Brennan  whose nomination I am opposing today  was asked directly  Is there any limit to your killing? Is there any geographic limitation to your drone strike program? Brennan responded and said  no  there is no limitation  Paul said during the first hour of filibustering Pauls issue was about the possibility of drone strikes in the United States After his filibuster  Attorney General Eric Holder addressed Pauls concerns in a letter Holder wrote that the president does not have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil In looking over Pauls statements during the filibuster  we wondered  Did Paul accurately characterize Brennans answer about geographic limitations to drone use in the global terror fight? Did Brennan say there was no geographic limitation? We reached out to Pauls office but did not hear back Still  we found three instances of Brennan addressing that issue In a speech in April 2012 at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars  Brennan    acknowledging the administrations drone program for the first time publicly    said drone strikes could be necessary outside of the battlefield At the time he was Obamas point person on counterterrorism strategy There is nothing in international law that bans the use of remotely piloted aircraft for this purpose or that prohibits us from using lethal force against our enemies outside of an active battlefield  at least when the country involved consents or is unable or unwilling to take action against the threat  he said In February 2013  ahead of hearings before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to confirm him as CIA director  Brennan reiterated that belief in response to written questions Question  Would you support legislation to authorize the use of force outside ofhot battlefields and codify the standards for the conduct of targeted strikes  including through the use of remotely piloted aircraft? Why or why not? Brennan replied   On your question about whether I would support legislation to authorize the use of force outside ofhot battlefields  I believe we currently have the authority to take action in such circumstances against al Qaida and associated forces As Jeh Johnson  the former General Counsel of the Department of Defense  indicated in a lecture at Yale Law School in February of last year  the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force does not contain a geographical limitation Consequently I do not believe additional legislation along these lines is necessary And in more written questions after his confirmation hearing  Brennan was again asked about geographical limits on the administrations drone strikes He noted   in part  the government has a responsibility to protect its citizens from these attacks  and  thus  as the attorney general has noted neither Congress nor our federal courts has limited the geographic scope of our ability to use force to the current conflict in Afghanistan But he went on to say  This does not mean  however  that we use military force whenever or wherever we want International legal principles  such as respect for another nations sovereignty  constrain our ability to act unilaterally Using force in another country is consistent with these international legal principles if conducted  for example  with the consent of the relevant nation   or if or when other governments are unwilling or unable to deal effectively with a threat to the United States We ran this issue by Paul Pillar  a former CIA official who now teaches at Georgetown University He responded  Sen Pauls comment is a generally correct characterization of Brennans answer regarding the absence of any geographic limitation on the administrations authority to conduct strikes Brennans further remark about other considerations coming into play is a way of saying that the administration does not wantonly conduct strikes around the world  but those considerations do not constitute ageographic limitation,6,0,713,real

14880,2017-12-29T15:31:28-05:00,2017,wwwinfowarscom,  Infowars,Pier 39 terrorist was an anti Trump antifa supporter,A criminal complaint against a suspect who the FBI said plotted a Christmas Day massacre in San Francisco focused on his expressions in support of ISIS and terrorism The conspiracy minded website Infowars said news reports omitted some of the true political affiliations of suspect Everitt Aaron Jameson  describing him as part of the anti Trump  radical left crowd Pier 39 terrorist was an anti Trump antifa supporter  stated the Dec 23 headline  Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated  as part of the social networks efforts to combat fake news The Infowars article zeroed in on Facebook pages liked by Jameson to portray him as a far left user who liked anti Trump and Antifa groups as well as news organizations such as CNN and BuzzFeed and pro vegan groups Jamesons Facebook likes confirm that his political leanings were a mixture of radical far left ideology and Islamism  stated Infowars We found Jameson did show some interest in anti Trump and Antifa groups  Antifa is a shorthand term for anti fascists  But the headline and story failed to explain that his interest in those groups were not relevant to the alleged plot laid out in the governments complaint FBI criminal complaint shows allegations against Jameson Here is what happened ahead of the planned incident  according to the FBI criminal complaint filed in California Dec 22  In September  a confidential source alerted the FBI that Jamesons Facebook account showed he liked or loved pro ISIS and terrorism posts  such as an image of Santa Claus standing in New York with a box of dynamite Jameson  a recent convert to Islam  had expressed support for radical jihadist beliefs and terrorism  including the Oct 31  2017  terror attack in New York City in which a driver used a truck to kill eight people Im glad to know we Muslims are finally hitting back  Jameson wrote on Facebook In December an undercover FBI employee began communicating with Jameson  who believed the agent was part of senior leadership in ISIS Jameson indicated that he wanted to plan an attack similar to the 2015 San Bernardino massacre and the recent New York truck attack Jameson named the Pier 39 site in San Francisco as his target because it is a heavily crowded area He asked the undercover employee to provide ammunition  assault rifle and materials to make explosives A couple of days later  an FBI employee mistakenly called Jameson and he called back the employees phone number which had a 202  Washington  DC  area code Later that day Jameson told the undercover FBI employee he reconsidered the attack On Dec 20  law enforcement conducted a search warrant and found an incriminating letter and several guns at Jamesons home The letter included one mention of Trump    a reference to Trumps recent recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel  Youve allowed Donald J Trump to give away Al Quds to the Jews Two days later  federal authorities announced that they had charged Jameson  a 26 year old Modesto truck driver  with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization If convicted  Jameson faces a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years in prison and a  250 000 fine Jamesons family said he was depressed over losing custody of his children and insisted he never talked about violence or being influenced by terrorist groups Jamesons federal public defender Heather E Williams told PolitiFact that her office will investigate the possibility of an entrapment defense and whether the government can prove beyond a reasonable doubt any attempted criminal act since Jameson ultimately told an FBI undercover employee that he had reconsidered In my understanding  the labelantifa meansanti fascist  If being anti Trump  anti fascist tends to show a person is more likely to be aterrorist than not  the FBI must have a very long list of suspicious people  she told PolitiFact Jamesons Facebook page The 11 page FBI criminal complaint and the press release from the US Attorney make no mention of Antifa  and the only reference to Trump is the one sentence in the letter seized at Jamesons home Mainstream news accounts of the case mentioned the sentence about Trump but nothing about Antifa Antifa broadly describes far left leaning militant groups challenging neo Nazis and white supremacists Infowars drew from an archived version of Jamesons Facebook that showed he liked four Antifa groups    three in California and one in Portland He also liked a few anti Trump groups  such as the Trump resistance movement We noticed that Jameson liked hundreds of groups on Facebook ranging from the political  Sassy Socialist Memes  to food  fashion  TV and sports We asked spokespersons for the FBI and the US Attorney if the fact that the complaint made no mention of Jameson liking anti Trump and Antifa means that it was irrelevant from a law enforcement perspective  but authorities declined to answer that question We posed the same question to a couple of experts on terrorism  Brian Levin at the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University  and Erin Miller  at the Global Terrorism Database at the University of Maryland Levin said federal authorities include information in the complaint that is relevant to the charge  which in this case was attempting to provide material support to foreign terrorist organizations ISIS is considered a foreign terrorist organization while Antifa isnt Thats why ISISlikes would be factually and legally relevant and the others would not  Levin said The focus of his alleged goals was aligned with ISIS and apparently less so than with the other entities which arent designated as foreign terrorist organizations His main interest is clearly ISIS and to suggest otherwise is not wholly accurate  Levin said Extremists are not hermetically sealed in freeze dried containers    they often dine from buffet of hatred but usually there is one that predominants and thats what we apparently have here  he said There is a broad spectrum within Antifa  which includes some individuals who have expressed violence But an abstract embrace of Antifa isnt illegal Like the anti abortion movement Antifa is itself an ideological movement  Miller said Like any ideological movement  individuals can identify with it Formal organizations can coalesce within around it Either can engage in non violent or violent efforts to in an attempt promote the ideology movement,0,0,1056,real

North Carolina has the worlds oldest voters ! It says there are thousands of registered voters in North Carolina who are 110 or more years old  including one person who is a whopping 219 years old Though tongue in cheek  the implication is clear   that many dead people are still actively registered  perhaps allowing others to commit voter fraud by casting ballots in their names Perhaps it is something in the  North  Carolina water  the email begins I doubt there is another state in the Union who could claim  as NC does  to have 5 376 voters 110 years old  or older One current voter was born in 1798  making him a rather hefty 219 years old  thereby  nearly doubling the age of the oldest person on earth If all this is true  it would clearly indicate some concerning irregularities The Gerontology Research Group  which tracks the oldest living people   has been able to verify only 43 people in the entire world age 110 or older as of May 3 The email concludes that this is more evidence that when you think of questionable elections   North  Carolina should be the FIRST state that comes to mind So we wanted to get to the bottom of which is fraudulent   this email  or the states voter rolls Following the presidents lead? The chain email began making the rounds  it appears  shortly after President Donald Trump announced a new committee on May 11 to look into voter fraud around the country Trump has consistently spread false claims about voter fraud  both during his presidential campaign and after winning the election He said millions of people voted illegally for Hillary Clinton and that he shouldve won the popular vote  which PolitiFact ruled Pants On Fire  In reality  studies have consistently shown that voter fraud is incredibly rare Trump has also made unfounded accusations of widespread voter fraud against several individual states   all of which have been rated Pants On Fire   including North Carolina   California   New Hampshire and Virginia  Those claims are either vague about the type of fraud or refer specifically to immigrants voting illegally None have claimed what this new chain email alleges  that dead people are somehow voting In years past  versions of this claim have been popular on conservative and right wing websites  internet forums and blogs   including Breitbart and the North Carolina based Civitas Institute  Why so many ancient voters? The chain emails most eye popping claim is about that 219 year old voter Its also the first mistake the email makes It refers to that person as a male  but a list of voters included in the email clearly shows he is really a she Theres more intrigue  In 2012  when Breitbart wrote about super old voters in North Carolina  it didnt mention anyone over 200 We wondered if this woman only recently decided   nearly a century since being eligible to vote   that now was the time to finally register So we asked Pat Gannon  the spokesman for the North Carolina State Board of Elections He said the state database does appear to show 5 391 people over 110   a few more than the email mentioned  even   but that there are several honest explanations For the 219 year old  he said  it amounts to just plain human error when a clerk was entering the persons information The219 year old voter was inadvertently given a birth date of 1797 instead of 1979  according to our research  Gannon wrote in an email Weve also determined that the voters that show up as 118  120 and 154 years old do so because of data entry errors Their dates of birth will soon be corrected in our database But that only covers four out of 5 391 What about the rest? Nearly all of them   975 percent   are what the state calls legacy voters Until the 1990s  people who registered to vote in North Carolina didnt have to list their date of birth They only had to promise they were at least 18 Then  in the late 2000s  the state digitized its voter records Gannon said anyone who was in the system with no date of birth was automatically listed as being born Jan 1 in either 1900 or 1901 Of the 5 391 voters who appear over 110 in the database  he said  5 257 fall into that category As for the other 130 questionable voters  24 percent of the total   Gannon said  some could still be alive  could be dead  or could be listed due to clerical errors like the four theyve already identified Most North Carolina voters who die are automatically removed from voter rolls  since they die in North Carolina or another state that shares its records with North Carolina But Gannon said some states dont share their records  including South Carolina and Virginia  the two states with the longest borders with North Carolina Any North Carolina voters who die in one of those states wont have their registrations revoked until either a family member notifies the state or eight years go by without that person voting And while its possible there are dead people on the voter rolls  people committing fraud by voting in their names is almost unheard of In the 2016 general election  two people in North Carolina were caught voting for dead family members  out of 48 million voters statewide who cast a ballot  according to a previous audit by the elections board,3,3,937,fake
1143,2009-08-18T18:26:15-04:00,2009,wwwfoxnewscom,J James Rohack,Pregnant women trying to buy health insurance on their own are barred from maternity coverage because they have a pre existing condition,Youve probably heard of pre existing conditions  which provide an escape clause for health insurance companies If you have a pre existing condition  an insurance company typically wont pay for treatment J James Rohack  president of the American Medical Association  cited them when he was asked during an appearance on Fox News Sunday on Aug 16  2009  whether the Democratic health plan would lead to rationing for older patients Well  theres a myth that rationing doesnt occur right now  Rohack said In the United States  if a womans pregnant and on the individual market  and  tries to get health insurance  thats called a pre existing condition and its not paid for Thats why this bills important It gets rid of some of the rationing thats occurring right now The AMA endorsed the House version of health care reform legislation in July First  we should emphasize that hes only talking about the relatively small number of women who buy their coverage through what insurers call the individual market About two thirds of women have health insurance through their employer or their spouses employer  and about 13 percent have public coverage such as Medicaid or military health care So the people affected by these limitations include the 19 percent now uninsured and the 6 percent that have coverage purchased on the individual market These policies are sold directly to an individual by a private insurer  and the purchaser doesnt get the same consumer protections routinely given to those who have coverage through an employer For example  people in employer based health plans have benefited from requirements for maternity coverage that date back to the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 But individual plans are not included under that umbrella and are regulated state by state In 39 states  listed here   insurers can turn down anyone for virtually any reason It can be because you have a pre existing condition  like cancer or diabetes And pregnancy almost always counts too  according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners  which represents the state government officials who regulate insurance sold within their borders So if youre pregnant and living in one of these 39 states  youre very likely out of luck in securing individual health coverage Youll have to pay for your care out of your own pocket or seek out charitable assistance And the coverage isnt much better in the remaining 11 states These states have guaranteed issue laws that say insurers cannot turn applicants down based on their health or risk status But theres a caveat  Even if an insurer must offer you a plan  it can place exclusions on what the plan covers Typically  the NAIC says  these exclusions last from six to 12 months  which rules out most or all maternity coverage  After the exclusion expires  the insurer does have to cover those conditions  meaning that a subsequent pregnancy could be covered  One category of individual policyholders has it slightly better ? those who leave an employers plan that had given them uninterrupted coverage for the pre existing condition in question Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996  or HIPAA  people in this category can obtain a plan that covers their pre existing condition once they have exhausted their old employers coverage under the law known as COBRA However  a state only has to provide a minimum of one HIPAA plan within its borders  rather than requiring that every insurer operating in the state offer one Such plans may have unfavorable terms and high premiums So back to Rohacks claim Health care reform legislation now under consideration in Congress would  if enacted  improve the situation for pregnant women seeking health insurance by prohibiting restrictions based on pre existing conditions But for now  Rohack is correct that pregnancy is considered a pre existing condition and prevents many women from getting coverage if they seek insurance on the individual market,1,0,650,real

Badar said  according to news reports   Watch his speech above  the relevant portion starts around the 9 50 mark   It is nothing less than forced assimilation  sought to be justif ied by exaggerated fear of a security threat  he added  The Australian anthem reads   Australians all let us rejoice  For we are young and free  Weve golden soil and wealth for toil  Our home is girt by sea  Our land abounds in natures gifts  Of beauty rich and rare  In historys page  let every stage Advance Australia Fair In joyful strains then let us sing  Advance Australia Fair Beneath our radiant Southern Cross  Well toil with hearts and hands  To make this Commonwealth of ours Renowned of all the lands  For those whove come across the seas Weve boundless plains to share  With courage let us all combine To advance Australia fair In joyful strains then let us sing  Advance Australia fair The LadyLibertysNewscom story did mention that the story was about Australia  but you had to read carefully to see that Their post on Facebook was even more deceptive It includes the caption  If youre offended by our beautiful flag  representing the blood that has been shed defending this great country  you can go back to the hell hole you came from!!

Basically  yeah  said Kelly Barton  an archivist at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley  Calif In the summer of 1967  during Reagans first year as governor  and contrary to his campaign promises  Reagan signed off on a record tax increase for the state of California   an 18 percent  roughly  1 billion hike According to Reagan biographer Lou Cannon  the increase included boosting sales taxes from three to five cents on the dollar  raising the maximum income tax from 7 to 10 percent  and increases in bank  corporation  inheritance  liquor and cigarette taxes A little context is in order In his autobiography  An American Life  Reagan said he inherited a  200 million deficit from his predecessor  Pat Brown Reagan ordered a hiring freeze and other spending cuts But Reagan was a Republican governor in a state where the legislature was controlled by the Democrats  and he wasnt able to muster support for additional cuts So  he ended up reluctantly signing off on the tax increases This is the second time in week that a Republican candidate has used Reagan to defend himself In a debate on Jan 5  2008  Rudy Giuliani correctly pointed out that Reagan had endorsed a policy of amnesty for some illegal aliens Read our ruling here Now  Huckabees math may be a little off on what that  1 billion would translate to today Its actually closer to  63 billion But the bottom line  Huckabees statement about Reagan is true,1,0,343,real

14932,2018-01-17T11:51:47-05:00,2018,threpublicancom,Republican News,First indictment issued in Russian bribery case tied to Obama era Uranium One deal,Several news websites have reported that the investigation of wrongdoing involving Uranium One and Hillary Clinton bagged its first indictment Facebook users flagged a post from a site called Republican News as suspicious and possibly fake The websites Jan 13 headline said  First indictment issued in Russian bribery case tied to Obama era Uranium One deal That post echoed similar reporting by the  New York Post   which announced theres an indictment in the FBI probe of the Uranium One scandal  also on Jan 13 The next day   The Hill  repeated the Post report There was an indictment  but the Justice Department doesnt tie it to the Uranium One deal Instead  the charges come out of a 2014 investigation of an American based kickback scheme that defrauded millions of dollars from a subsidiary of the Russian nuclear agency Rosatom The kickback scheme and Rosatoms 2010 purchase of a controlling interest in the Canadian company Uranium One were entirely separate The kickback plan locked in contracts for an American firm to import Russian uranium The other deal involved buying Uranium One stock They involved different Rosatom subsidiaries and different activities The news reports tied the two together  but none gave details on the connection The DOJ handed down an indictment in the Uranium One deal  Republican News said THIS is what the media was trying so hard to cover up But it provided no evidence Lets unpack this The indictment Mark Lambert is the former co president of Transport Logistics International  a Maryland company that arranged the transport of nuclear materials to the United States According to the Jan 12 indictment   between at least as early as 2009 and 2014  Lambert and his partner funneled money to a Russian official with Tenex  the company in charge of exporting Russian uranium Through an elaborate kickback scheme  the Maryland firm got the contracts to ship Russian uranium to the United States Tenex paid handsomely for the firms services  and the Maryland firm shared some of the proceeds with the Russian official In short  Tenex paid for the bribery Lamberts indictment on Jan 12  2018  was just the most recent step in a long running case against his company That investigation made no mention of Uranium One In 2014  the Justice Department charged Lamberts business partner   the Russian Tenex official and two others  including the wife of the business partner  with bribery  fraud and money laundering All told  about  21 million ended up in overseas bank accounts controlled by the Russian For the record  the indictment of the Russian official said the scheme started in 2004 Thats six years before the Uranium One sale was on the table Lamberts business partner and the Russian had pled guilty in 2015 The Russian is serving a two year prison term  and the business partner is awaiting sentencing A Uranium One refresher In 2010  the Russian nuclear agency Rosatom wanted to become the majority owner of the Canadian firm Uranium One Uranium One had holdings in the United States  so the deal had to win approval by a number of state and federal agencies That group included the State Department  then led by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Our summary of the case gives plenty of details   but the gist is some of the owners of Uranium One had given millions to the Clinton Foundation One in particular gave the foundation between  13 million and  56 million while the sale was under review On the 2016 campaign trail  candidate Donald Trump cast the donations as a payoff to grease the skids for approval There is no evidence that Clinton had a hand in the vetting process  an undertaking that involved eight federal offices in addition to the State Department Recently  Republicans have called for a fresh investigation of the matter The Justice Department has made no official comment The department recently allowed an FBI informant in the Tenex bribery case to testify before a Senate committee investigating the Uranium One transaction It is unknown what if anything new that informant might provide The indictment Rosatom connection How does the recent indictment link to the Uranium One sale? Aside from the tie to Rosatom  not in any obvious way The Maryland firm was in cahoots with Vadim Mikerin  a Russian national who was the general director of Tenam USA  the American arm of Tenex Tenex is a subsidiary of JSC Atomenergoprom  which in turn is a subsidiary of Rosatom Rosatom bought the controlling share in Uranium One through another subsidiary There is no evidence that the kickback scheme that defrauded Tenex overlapped with Rosatoms efforts to buy Uranium One None of the news reports that claimed a connection provided any evidence In fact  the New York Post article incorrectly said  The federal investigation grew from charges that the Obama administration covered up an FBI probe of the uranium business   and thus allowed the Russian firm Tenex to buy a stake in Uranium One But Tenex was not the buyer As a subsidiary of Rosatom  its role was to export Russian uranium  a very different business activity The Rosatom subsidiary that bought the stake in Uranium One was Atomredmetzoloto Law professor Michael Koehler at Southern Illinois University School of Law is an expert on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and has written about the Tenex prosecutions He reviewed the indictment and saw no tie between the two matters Last weeks case concerns the same core conduct the Justice Department brought action on in June 2015  Koehler said While any FBI investigation of the Uranium One deal lies behind a veil of secrecy at the department  Koehler said the idea that it might have spurred the latest indictment is highly unlikely,1,0,950,fake

Hes right Who pays Its clear Romney is referring to federal taxes and his figure mirrors one from the Urban Institute Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center  which found that in 2011  46 percent of tax filers paid no income tax  vs about 54 percent of tax filers that did have some federal income tax liability In 2009  the Tax Policy Center estimated the proportion who paid no taxes was 47 percent About half of people who dont pay income taxes are simply poor  and the tax code explicitly exempts them For example  a couple with two children earning less than  26 400 will pay no federal income tax this year because their  11 600 standard deduction and four exemptions of  3 700 each reduce their taxable income to zero  Roberton Williams  a scholar with the Tax Policy Center  wrote last year  The basic structure of the income tax simply exempts subsistence levels of income from tax The remaining Americans who owe no federal income taxes are benefiting from tax breaks  the center found Three fourths of those households pay no income tax because of provisions that benefit senior citizens and low income working families with children Those provisions include the exclusion of some Social Security benefits from taxable income  the tax credit and extra standard deduction for the elderly  and the child  earned income  and child care tax credits that primarily help low income workers with children  he wrote PolitiFact Oregon examined a claim similar to this one last year  citing research by the Joint Committee on Taxation  a bipartisan committee of Congress The committee found that for 2009  roughly 22 percent of tax units ended up without any tax liability Another 30 percent got all their tax money back from the government  through mechanisms such as the Earned Income Tax Credit  which encourages low income Americans to work by refunding money to them through the tax code By contrast  the committee found just 49 percent of Americans owed anything to the government Put another way  51 percent of taxpayers in 2009 had zero liability  according to the committees research,1,0,674,real

Biden responded by taking issue with the word partition    which was often used to describe Bidens plan at the time    saying it was never about breaking Iraq into three separate countries I dont want to debate history here  but I never called for a partition  Biden said I called for a central government with considerable autonomy in the regions It was to allow them more autonomy  Biden said  And so whats happening here is  there is an election thats taken place And what happened   theres 325 plus members of what they call their core  their parliament And no one party won more than 91 seats The two major parties  one won 89 and one won 91 seats Thats Maliki and Allawi  Iraqiya and the State of Law  they call them Theyre in negotiations right now to figure out how to allocate the power within that government In other words  share power And it is about just that And its underway And its going to happen There will be a central government with control of its foreign policy  with control of the military But you will see that there are going to be significant amounts of autonomy in each of the areas that exist in these provinces Thats what their constitution calls for Check the headlines in 2007  and its clear that the word partition or soft partition was often used to describe Bidens proposal  which called for boundaries to be drawn for the countrys Kurdish  Sunni and Shiite populations And so we decided to check his claim that he never called for a partition Bidens strategy was first outlined in an op ed piece for the New York Times on May 1  2006  which Biden co wrote with Leslie H Gelb  president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations  The idea  as in Bosnia  is to maintain a united Iraq by decentralizing it  giving each ethno religious group   Kurd  Sunni Arab and Shiite Arab   room to run its own affairs  while leaving the central government in charge of common interests The plan  they wrote would be to establish three largely autonomous regions with a viable central government in Baghdad The Kurdish  Sunni and Shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws  administration and internal security The central government would control border defense  foreign affairs and oil revenues Baghdad would become a federal zone  while densely populated areas of mixed populations would receive both multisectarian and international police protection Some will say moving toward strong regionalism would ignite sectarian cleansing  Biden wrote But thats exactly what is going on already  in ever bigger waves Others will argue that it would lead to partition But a breakup is already under way As it was in Bosnia  a strong federal system is a viable means to prevent both perils in Iraq In 2007  Biden and Sen Sam Brownback  R Kansas  successfully shepherded a nonbinding  sense of the Senate resolution that proposed separating Iraq into three semi autonomous regions with a federal government The resolution passed the Senate 75 to 23 The resolution called for the US to actively support a political settlement among Iraqs major factions based upon the provisions of the Constitution of Iraq that create a federal system of government and allow for the creation of federal regions And last  we point you to the fuller comments Biden made from the floor of the Senate on April 24  2007  when Biden said the idea that the Iraqi people would rally behind a strong central government was fundamentally and fatally flawed As an alternative  Biden said  You make federalism work for the Iraqis You give them control over the fabric of their daily lives You separate the parties You give them breathing room Let them control their local police  their education  their religion  their marriage Thats the only possibility Change the focus to a limited central government and a federal system that their Constitution calls for I cant guarantee that my strategy will work  but I can guarantee that the road the president  Bush  has us on leads to nowhere with no end in sight Biden addressed the partition issue head on in an Oct 3  2007 op ed co written with Gelb for the Washington Post   Our plan is not partition  though even some supporters and the media mistakenly call it that It would hold Iraq together by bringing to life the federal system enshrined in its constitution A federal Iraq is a united Iraq but one in which power devolves to regional governments  with a limited central government responsible for common concerns such as protecting borders and distributing oil revenue So is it fair to call Bidens plan a call to partition Iraq? Certainly Biden advocated carving out three semi autonomous regions In that sense  we could see why many characterized Bidens proposal as a soft partition But the word partition carries heavy political implications  namely the creation of three separate nations And that was never Bidens plan He consistently upheld the idea of one Iraq with a central government  albeit a more modest one responsible for such things as defense  foreign affairs and sharing oil revenues Thats an important distinction,2,0,1020,real

I dont know about you  but Im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change The number is based on a presidential support score from Congressional Quarterly  which rates how often lawmakers back or oppose the president Since 2001  McCain has  in fact  backed the presidents position an average of 90 percent of the time By congressional standards  thats solidly partisan  but hardly marching in lockstep McCain supported Bush as infrequently as 77 percent of the time in 2005  and as high as 95 percent of the time in 2007 We should also note some factors that helped to drive up McCains 2007 score  which was partly a reflection of the new political calculus in the Democratic controlled Congress That year  McCain missed more than half the votes on which Bush had a position  as he campaigned for the White House But repeated votes on immigration and the Iraq war   two issues on which he was closely allied with Bush   as well as filibuster votes helped elevate McCain from one of the presidents chief Republican adversaries three years ago to one of his biggest supporters Over the course of the election  weve looked at this statistic a couple of times  and in a couple variations In June  we ruled it True when Obama said McCain decided to stand with George Bush 95 percent of the time  last year  But we dinged running mate Joe Biden a bit when he said at an Aug 23  2008  rally in Springfield  Ill  You cant change America when you supported George Bushs policies 95 percent of the time Because Biden didnt note a year when he cited McCains highest presidential support score   thereby suggesting an overall score   we ruled his statement only Half True Here  Obama cites McCains average presidential support score since Bush was elected We checked our math  and although we had first said Obama was off by 1 percent  we have since realized that Obama wasnt  we were Its 90 percent on the nose True,1,0,475,real

Gallup pollsters found that 82 percent opposed such aid That was the highest level of opposition recorded in six Gallup polls between April 2011 and February 2012 Even the lowest level of opposition found in these polls    52 percent in April 2011    meant that a majority opposed US aid So its a stance that seems pretty widespread in Egypt in recent years In a September 2012 analysis of its survey results  Gallup wrote that Egyptians may resent US aid for the same reason some members of Congress are calling it into question    it is seen as a tool of US influence with Egypts government The attitudes Gallup found are mirrored in Pew poll data from spring 2013 Pew asked Egyptians  Overall  would you say US economic aid to Egypt is having a mostly positive impact  a mostly negative impact  or no impact on the way things are going in Egypt? Overall  24 percent of respondents said mostly positive  55 percent said mostly negative and 18 percent said no impact When the wording of the question was varied to say military aid rather than economic aid  attitudes turned even more negative Ten percent of respondents said mostly positive  58 percent said mostly negative and 28 percent said no impact These findings rang true with experts we contacted There is no doubt that there are large numbers of Egyptians who dont want our aid  said Steven A Cook  a senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations While Pauls claim is accurate  theres one thing worth noting The polls Gallup  and Pew  conducted did not use the familiar telephone based random sampling technique most commonly seen in the United States The Gallup poll used face to face interviews conducted in Arabic with 1 000 adults age 15 and older Gallup has explained that face to face surveys are normally conducted  by dividing a given population into blocks of roughly equal population density Each block is further divided into blocks until a single household is chosen at random  and then a single respondent is randomly chosen from the household The use of this methodology doesnt mean such polls arent trustworthy    if US style telephone methods had been workable in Egypt  Gallup could have used them    but the approach is so different that we think its a point worth noting According to Gallup  the margin of sampling error for the April 2012 survey was 3 percentage points  though the company also acknowledges that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls Pew  for its part  makes clear that security concerns for pollsters made it impossible to include about 2 percent of the population that lives in frontier regions,2,0,748,real

And was there really a Senate Appropriations Committee chairman who dared to buck his party on this key issue?

LaPierre responded  I think the National Instant Check System  the way its working now  is a failure Because this administration is not prosecuting the people that they catch Twenty three states are not even putting the mental records of those adjudicated mentally incompetent into the system Now  assume that if you dont prosecute  and they try to buy a gun  even if you catch them  and you let them walk away  to assume theyre not going to get a gun    theyre criminals  theyre homicidal maniacs  and theyre mentally ill I mean  we all know that homicidal maniacs  criminals and the insane  dont abide by the law The NRAs website on March 12  2013  posted its firm stance against expanding background checks,1,0,693,real

You can be fairly certain the answer to that is no Not only does torture undermine what we know works  which is public cooperation  but it can also deeply alter the duration  severity and cost of a conflict  he said Torture alienates societies needed for war efforts  said Hajjar Senate torture report When we contacted the Clinton campaign  spokesman Josh Schwerin directed us to the report by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence   released when Democrats controlled the Senate The full document  about 6 700 pages and approved in 2012  remains classified A 525 page redacted executive summary was released in December 2014 Theres also a minority report developed by Republicans on the committee and a CIA response  The majority report says techniques such as waterboarding  standing sleep deprivation  forced feeding through a rectal tube  temperature extremes and confinement in coffin sized boxes were not effective for getting intelligence from people detained after the Sept 11  2001  terrorist attacks The committees analysis of 20 prominent cases that reportedly saved lives   cited by the CIA and the Bush administration   found either that the key information was gathered before torture began  the information was already available to the intelligence community before the enhanced techniques were initiated  or there was no relationship between those success stories and the information provided by the detainees For example   the majority report says that CIA records reveal that 34 percent of the 119 known CIA detainees produced no intelligence reports Another example  The CIA said Ghul  the detainee who gave information that eventually led to the location of bin Laden  had been subjected to harsh interrogation and had produced valuable information The agency neglected to mention that the information came before Ghul was subjected to enhanced interrogation Other instances where the Bush administration said enhanced interrogation   described by the president as tough  safe  lawful and necessary   produced valuable intelligence have also been debunked  The minority report says that in many of the 20 cases  enhanced interrogation tactics did produce significant breakthroughs  although sometimes as part of a delayed cascade effect The problem with most of the accounts of people who say that torture works  said Rejali  is that only the cases where it seemed to succeed are remembered and the ones where it didnt are forgotten In the two and a half years following the Sept 11  2001  terrorist attacks  US intelligence agencies arrested more that 5 000 suspected terrorists  said Mark Costanzo of Claremont McKenna College and Ellen Gerrity of Duke University  writing in the journal Social Issues and Policy Review There was sufficient hard evidence to bring formal charges against only three of these suspects  and only one of these three was convicted,1,0,1202,real

MITT ROMNEY  No  what Im saying is that what he just said  I think most people agree with  although the term Ponzi scheme I think is over the top and unnecessary and frightful to many people But the real issue is in writing his book  Gov Perry pointed out that in his view that Social Security is unconstitutional  that this is not something the federal government ought to be involved in  that instead it should be given back to the states And I think that view  and the view that somehow Social Security has been forced on us over the past 70 years that by any measure  again quoting book  by any measure Social Security has been a failure  this is after 70 years of tens of millions of people relying on Social Security  thats a very different matter Romneys source? Perrys 2010 book  Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington We pulled out our copy and found the correct passage  Read more from PolitiFact about Perrys book  Five pages into a section called  Runaway Entitlement Spending  on Page 62  Perry writes  By any measure  Social Security is a failure As author Jim Powell points out in FDRs Folly  one pro FDR historian justified Social Security not on its merits but as an important symbolic gesture to demonstrate that Roosevelts heart was in the right place This sounds a lot like justifying the current administrations policies because well meaning politicians want to provide hope Now  if you say Social Security is a failure  as I have just done  you will inherit the wind of political scorn Seniors might think you want to cut the benefits they have paid for Politicians will seek to take advantage  stirring up fear about benefits that will be lost if you elect another heartless Republican I get it Thats why only retired senators chair entitlement commissions We are told that no politician has the courage to raise these issues  even if avoiding them puts us on the fast track to financial run But by remaining quiet  politicians are really saying they think the American people wont understand it if we share the grim details of our financial future  and that voters will simply kill    or vote against    the messenger in order to continue to receive an underfunded benefit that robbed them of the tens of thousands of dollars they should have made Is that how we should respect our fellow citizens? So indeed  Perry said Social Security is a failure  he even acknowledged that doing so means he will inherit the wind of political scorn What did Perry mean by the tens of thousands of dollars they should have made? In the same section of the book he says payroll taxes would have been better left in workers pockets  If only the New Dealers had been kind enough to allow workers to make their own choice about whether to participate As we know from experience  individuals would have done better on their own He points out that many private pension plans return 8 percent per year  compared to Social Securitys paltry 2 percent or less Then he offers the example of three Texas counties that opted out of Social Security for a private option before that door was shut in 1983 Employees in those private plans  having exercised their liberty at Washingtons sufferance  are reaping the benefits He doesnt address Social Securitys other roles  such as disability insurance and survivors benefits  nor what he believes should happen to low income workers who under Social Security draw more in retirement benefits then theyre able to contribute in payroll taxes Does Perry stand by his 2010 book? Less than a month ago he told a reporter in Des Moines  I havent backed off anything in my book So read the book again and get it right On Sept 11  2011  he clarified for  USA Today   As I said at the Reagan Library recently  Social Security benefits for current recipients and those nearing retirement must be protected For younger workers  we must consider reforms to make Social Security financially viable But Romney made it clear he was quoting from Perrys book He said In writing his book  Gov Perry pointed out that  by any measure Social Security has been a failure And indeed  in Perrys book  Fed Up!  he touts the benefits of private plans and says  By any measure  Social Security is a failure,5,2,830,real
4372,2011-09-01T12:05:52-04:00,2011,wwwpbsorg,Robert Reich,The ratio of corporate profits to wages is now higher than at any time since just before the Great Depression,In an Aug 29  2011  column   Robert Reich  the former Labor Secretary under President Bill Clinton and a frequent liberal commentator  offered a number of statistics to back up his call for worker protests rather than parades on Labor Day Labor Day is traditionally a time for picnics and parades  Reichs column began But this year is no picnic for American workers  and a protest march would be more appropriate than a parade One of the statistics Reich offered was this  The ratio of corporate profits to wages is now higher than at any time since just before the Great Depression A reader asked us to check this out  so we did We turned to statistics compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis  the federal office that calculates official statistics about the economy We found numbers for corporate profits as well as for two measures of worker income    wage and salary disbursements  and total employee compensation received We then divided corporate profits by both of the income measurements  all the way back to 1929   Here are the full statistics from 1929 to 2011 as we calculated them  For wages  we found that Reich was essentially correct The ratio in 2010    the last full year in the statistics    was 281  which was higher than any year back to at least 1929  the earliest year in the BEA database The next highest ratio was in 2006  at 265  We didnt find pre 1929 data  so the one part of Reichs statement that we cant prove is that the ratio was higher just before the Great Depression  We also looked at total compensation  since the portion of worker compensation delivered outside of wages has grown significantly since 1929 The numbers were slightly different  but the general pattern still held The ratio in 2010 was 226  which was matched or exceeded in only four years    1941  1942  1943 and 1950 To capture the most up to date trends  we also looked at the ratios for the last six quarters For both wages and compensation  the ratio has risen steadily over that year and a half period For wages  the ratio has climbed from 274 in the first quarter of 2010 to 290 in the second quarter of 2011 For compensation  the ratio has risen from 220 in the first quarter of 2010 to 234 in the second quarter of 2011 So numerically  theres little question that Reich is essentially right  Or  at least for now he is Economists note that statistics about corporate profits and wages are often revised after the fact  A more interesting question is what this trendline actually means First  well note that the ratio has been remarkably steady over the time we studied In 2010  corporate income was 168 times what it was in 1929  and wages were 124 times what they were in 1929 But despite the dramatic increases for both measures individually  these two numbers have grown pretty much in tandem While corporate profits have grown faster  they havent grown dramatically faster Over the eight decade period  the ratio between corporate profits and wages    at least prior to 2010    almost always hovered between 150 and 235  a pretty narrow range  all things considered Within this range  the ratio has regularly zigzagged up and down The ratio has peaked during World War II  the early 1950s  the mid1960s  the mid1990s and the middle of the first decade of the 21st century The 2010 high broke with this history  making the statistic Reich is talking about all the more striking And as the quarterly data shows  the spike from 2010 has continued into 2011 This spike has its roots in basic mathematics The ratio can rise for either of two reasons    because corporate profits rise  or because wages stagnate To a greater degree than in past recessions  both of these developments have happened simultaneously in 2010 and 2011 Thats the immediate reason for the ratios sudden increase The ratio was well within historical norms as recently as 2009  the second year of the recession Today  indicators favorable to workers are either absolutely dreadful  like the percentage of the adult population that is employed  or else improving at a not very robust rate  like real compensation per hour  while indicators favorable to business owners  such as record profit levels measured in billions of current dollars  are very delightful indeed  said Gary Burtless  an economist at the centrist to liberal Brookings Institution There are any number of explanations for why businesses are so reluctant to invest their profits today For instance  Dan Mitchell  an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute  said the pattern of low corporate investment that were seeing today has to do with a climate of economic uncertainty  largely thanks to the threat of more taxes and regulations But the explanation that seems to mesh best with our numbers has to do with economic cycles While the ratio Reich points to is exaggerated today due to an unusually deep recession and an especially sluggish recovery  the general pattern follows that of other recent recessions  said JD Foster  an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation Typically  businesses initially lose ground during a recession  while workers suffer somewhat less  in part due to sticky wages    the tendency for worker pay to increase or stagnate rather than fall  even in hard times This pattern tends to decrease the ratio of corporate profits to wages However  when the recovery begins  the reverse becomes true    businesses tend to gain ground faster than workers do  since soft labor markets prevent workers from reaping the rewards of improved productivity This pushes the ratio of profits to wages higher Since the current recovery is particularly weak  the increase in the ratio has been even stronger than normal The hopeful news for workers  Foster says  is that once a recovery gathers steam and new capital labor equilibrium is reached  workers tend to accelerate their gains Once a strong recovery is under way and labor markets return to normal  total labor compensation tends to catch up  as employers bid for employees out of the extra profit margin they accumulated during the recovery  Foster said So once we start heading toward full employment  we can expect total labor compensation

HELP US RAISE  15 000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT CHECKER Its important to note that Trump hasnt been charged with any illegal activity  and its reasonable to argue that he was unaware or even a victim in some cases But Cruz has a point that the mogul has been linked to the mob for decades Mob control afact of life Before we detail Trumps alleged ties  none of this proves that Trump was happy doing business with the mafia or even in cahoots with them at all La Cosa Nostra had a virtual monopoly on concrete in New York at the time Trump was adding his name to its skyline in the 1980s And the mafias control over building supplies and labor unions meant that the crime families had a hand in most construction projects in Manhattan Trump and other major developers had to adapt to that situation or build elsewhere  said James B Jacobs  a mafia expert who was part of a state task force on organized crime That was the fact of life  that was the way it was  he told PolitiFact The contractors and developers werent pure victims You could bribe the mob controlled union leaders and get relief from the more arduous conflicts But we had no information that Trump was any different That being said  Trumps business dealings with the mob or mob related characters are widely documented Lets run through them Mafia concrete for Trump Plaza Trump was first tied to the mafia in the 1980s  when a  78 million subcontract for Trump Plaza was awarded to S A Concrete  according to  Fortune  The company  as Cruz correctly says  was partially owned by Anthony Fat Tony Salerno  the boss of the Genovese crime family Trump himself acknowledged as much in a December 2015 interview with the Wall Street Journal  admitting that S A Concrete was supposedly associated with the mob Virtually every building that was built was built with these companies  he said  adding  These guys were excellent contractors They were phenomenal They could do three floors a week in concrete Nobody else in the world could do three floors a week I mean they were unbelievable Trump Tower  other buildings When Salerno was indicted in 1986  the charges specifically mentioned Trump Plaza Salernos 1992 obituary ends with a nod to the luxury highrise and 15 other Manhattan buildings Trump World Tower  supported by the Quadrozzi Concrete Company  is also tangentially related to La Cosa Nostra The head of the company  John Quadrozzi Sr  was tied to the Lucchese crime family and indicted for making illegal payoffs to the mob in 1992 TIME and Daily Beast have speculated that Trump Tower was also built with mafia influence  though the evidence is less concrete Atlantic City partnerships Trumps alleged mob dealings were not confined to New York According to reports from the Huffington Post and Philadelphia Inquirer   Trump made a deal in Atlantic City with Kenneth Shapiro  an associate of mob boss Nicky Scarfo   and mob connected labor boss Daniel Sullivan  Trump seemed aware of this  calling Shapiro a third rate  local real estate mafia and Sullivan the guy who killed Jimmy Hoffa Nonetheless  in 1981  Trump leased a portion of the land for Trump Plaza and Casino from a company the two men controlled  according a report by New Jersey gaming regulators The company refused to cooperate with the authorities  and Trump eventually ended the partnership and bought out their shares Later Trump brought on Sullivan as a labor negotiator at the Grand Hyatt Hotel and introduced the man to his own banker  according to the Los Angeles Times  Through intermediaries Trump bought the property for the casino from the crown prince of the Philadelphia mob  Salvatore Testa  for  11 million in 1982 Multiple media reports and an unauthorized biography about Trump allege this was more than twice its market value  Testa purchased the property in 1977 for  195 000   According to  The Federalist   two construction companies controlled by Nicky Scarfo ended up building Trump Plaza and Casino You had contractors that were supposedly mob oriented all over Atlantic City  Trump said when the Wall Street Journal asked him about it  adding that every single casino company used the same companies  just I hope you will say that A few years later  Trumps organized crime connections extended overseas In 1992  a Senate subcommittee named Danny Leung  who was then the vice president for foreign marketing at Trump Taj Mahal  as an associate of the Hong Kong based organized crime group 14K Triad Leung has also given complimentary tickets for hotel rooms and Asian shows to numerous members and associates of Asian organized crime  reads the report  which also identified three other triad connected business associates or former employees of Trumps gambling empire According to gaming regulators  Leung flew in 16 Italian organized crime figures from Canada who stole more than  1 million from the casino in a credit scam  reported the New York Daily News in 1995 The incident was never reported because Trump never filed charges Leung  who had a separate contract to bring gamblers from Toronto to the casino  denied the affiliation to organized crime  and his casino and junket licenses were renewed  The Trump Taj Mahal declared bankruptcy in 1991  and his other Atlantic City properties folded a decade later  Mob linked business adviser And theres Felix Sater  a twice convicted Russian migr who served prison time and had documented mafia connections and the subject of the ABC story Cruz referenced Sater pleaded guilty to a charge of money laundering in 1998 and was indicted again in 2000 for taking part in a  40 million stock scheme involving four Mafia families  according to the New York Times report  From 2003 to 2007  Sater traveled the country promoting projects for Trump  and his company was a partner in the Trump SoHo hotel Trump told the Times he never knew that Three years later  Sater returned to the Trump Organization and had business cards

Deferring to the feds Legislators faced a unique challenge during their 60 day session in 2013 Unlike many states that had laid groundwork to implement the Affordable Care Act since it became law in 2010  Florida had repeatedly refused   first challenging the constitutionality of the law  then waiting to see if a new president would offer a reprieve But with the law upheld by the Supreme Court and President Barack Obama back in office  the state was stuck It had refused federal money to help with the transition Now it was also running out of time A state Senate committee in 2013 said it sought a rational  reasonable approach State law needed an update to match federal requirements of the Affordable Care Act The committee sought to do as little as possible We want to make sure that were in compliance  that were doing what were required to do  said Sen David Simmons  R Altamonte Springs  at a March committee meeting The Affordable Care Act assumed that states would continue to take a lead role in setting insurance rates  just as Florida had done in the past It encouraged states to strengthen their rate setting authority  offering millions of dollars in grant money to help But it didnt require that The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation faced a serious time crunch to get up to speed on a host of new requirements under the law Legislators offered a compromise If the federal government wanted to impose new coverage requirements   well  it could set rates  too Since the federal government is requiring these additional coverages that will cost more  said Sen Joe Negron  Republican chair of the Affordable Care Act Committee  then to me it makes sense for them to be responsible for approving rate increases that are certain to come Democrats on the committee agreed with this approach at its final meeting on March 18  I think were going to find its going to cost us a lot of money to set rates here in Florida  said Sen Eleanor Sobel  I think we should rely on the federal government She expressed confidence the federal government would have a greater wealth of knowledge If we have concerns about the rates that the feds do set  then we should work with them  she said One hitch she didnt mention  the federal government didnt give itself rate making authority What resulted was Florida Senate Bill 1842   which among other things  suspended for two years the requirement that insurers get state approval for rates for new plans   such as those that will appear on new marketplaces Companies would still have to file rate changes with the state But they could act on those changes without approval Sobel now says that wasnt at all clear at the time The bill earned unanimous support from the Senate Appropriations Committee  then passed the Senate 28 8   mostly along party lines Six senators voted after roll call  including Sobel  who changed her vote from yea to nay I was reading very quickly Then I realized this was something that was not good for the people of the state of Florida  she said The 78 36 House vote also mostly followed party lines  with a few Democratic supporters Gov Scott expressed the same confidence that the federal government would step in When he signed the bill into law May 31  he wrote  I support the Legislatures deference to the federal government  Rates for the new plans will be reviewed by the same federal government that will be enforcing and updating new rules and regulations throughout this very fluid and uncertain transition period Limits of federal authority Heres the thing  The federal government  even under the Affordable Care Act  cant do what Insurance Commissioner McCarty can do Florida grants its insurance commissioner a range of powers McCarty can negotiate lower rates with companies He can refuse rates that the state determines to be too high The federal government can do neither of those things On July 31  the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation released projected insurance premiums for policies that will be for sale on the new health insurance marketplaces launching in January 2014   premiums it has no authority to review The state estimated rate increases in the individual market between 8 percent and 59 percent  The federal government and consumer groups  we should note  dispute the states projections   with one group suggesting theyre inaccurately and irresponsibly high to discourage Floridians from participating in Obamacare  In a bulleted list  the office noted all of the ways the Affordable Care Act might be driving up costs It didnt mention McCarty had no power to negotiate or refuse because of the new law And that matters A Kaiser Family Foundation study in 2010 found that those states with robust authority to approve or disapprove rates were able to extract significant reductions While Florida used the Affordable Care Act as a reason to reduce its rate oversight  most states used the laws grants to boost theirs  North Carolina reduced a rate increase request with its new authority in 2010 that saved beneficiaries  145 million The  Palm Beach Post  noted that Maryland used its negotiating power to push rates for next years premiums down by as much as a third from what companies had proposed In the absence of oversight from Florida  the federal government does have some power to protect Florida consumers from outrageous rates   even if it cant rescind them or otherwise impose penalties Chief is the new requirement that insurers must spend at least 80 percent or 85 percent of premiums on medical care  or pay rebates So  if an insurer filed for a rate increase that granted it profits far beyond the benefits it offered  it would owe consumers a rebate the next year Second  it could refuse to let an insurer sell its product on Floridas federally run marketplace But not all insurance will be sold through the marketplace Meanwhile  the process was supposed to rely on states determination of whether a rate was justified Lastly  it wields shame If Florida doesnt weigh in  the federal government will review any increase greater than 10 percent to evaluate whether its unreasonable   a designation the insurer

2964,2010-12-15T14:01:53-05:00,2010,www2tbocom,Barack Obama,When Social Security was passed  there were all kinds of lawsuits  just as there have been in the legal battle over the new health care law,During a White House interview with Tampas WFLA TV on Dec 13  2010  President Barack Obama reacted to a decision earlier that day to strike down a key portion of the health care law passed earlier this year In the recently announced ruling   US District Court Judge Henry E Hudson of Virginia declared unconstitutional the laws requirement that individuals purchase health insurance or face a penalty In the interview  Keith Cate  an anchor at NBC affiliate News Channel 8  asked the president for his thoughts on the ruling Obama began by noting that other lower courts had issued more favorable rulings  and that the issue was destined to go through additional legal steps on its way to the Supreme Court Thats the nature of these things  Obama said When Social Security was passed  there were all kinds of lawsuits When the Civil Rights Act was passed and the Voting Rights Act was passed  there were all kinds of lawsuits In this item  well focus on the Social Security Act  in part because we thought wed give the president a second chance after earning a False from us on a different comment about the early history of Social Security It turns out that in his second historical comment  the president was accurate Even though American society was less litigious in the 1930s  the creation of Social Security    which is a landmark moment in the history of the federal government    did attract not just one lawsuit that reached the Supreme Court  but three And as we looked deeper into the history of the legal battle over Social Security  the more we noticed how much its details echo the battle playing out now over the health care law So well provide an overview of the history here  in which we rely heavily on by an official history of the period written in 1999 by Social Security Administration historian Larry DeWitt Even though the Social Security Act was enacted into law on August 14  1935  the country still had to hear from the Supreme Court  DeWitt wrote This was a new  untested area of federal authority and it was inevitable that it would be challenged in the courts  and until the Supreme Court ruled  no one could be sure that the nascent Social Security Act would survive its infancy DeWitt noted that under the 10th Amendment  powers not given to the federal government are left to the states or the people  so the federal government  in its defense of the Social Security Act  would have to find justification in the Constitution for the expansion of its powers Even before the Social Security Act was passed  other parts of President Franklin D Roosevelts New Deal    the cluster of programs designed to alleviate the Great Depression    had been subject to legal attacks and in some cases were ruled unconstitutional by lower courts for overstepping federal powers  just as one of the requirements of the health care law has been In 1935 and 1936  a sharply divided Supreme Court    split between three liberals  four conservatives and two swing votes    invalidated the Railroad Retirement Act  the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act The defeat of three pillars of the New Deal drove Roosevelt to propose  in early 1937  an ill fated court packing scheme in which he would expand the number of justices  thus shifting the courts ideological complexion in his direction The proposal was soundly defeated by Congress  with significant collateral damage to Roosevelts standing with the public and historians But beginning in March 1937  one of the swing justices  Owen Roberts  shifted from the opponents camp to become a supporter of New Deal programs  enabling a minimum wage law  the National Labor Relations Act and the Social Security Act to stand Three specific cases attacking Social Security reached the Supreme Court In one  the Steward Machine Company case  the company sued over having to pay unemployment insurance tax under the law Another case  Carmichael vs Southern Coal   Coke Co and Gulf States Paper  challenged a different facet of the unemployment provision having to do with the states But the most directly relevant for Obamas comment was Helvering vs Davis  in which George P Davis  a minority stockholder in an electric company  objected to being forced to pay the payroll tax that funded the old age insurance program The administration  represented by Internal Revenue Service commissioner Guy T Helvering  filed suit to force compliance The attorneys for Davis argued that the payroll tax was a new type of tax not listed in the Constitutions tally of taxes  and so it was unconstitutional  DeWitt wrote At one point they even introduced into their argument the definitions of taxes from dictionaries in 1788  the year before the Constitution was ratified  to prove how earnest they were in the belief that powers not explicitly granted in 1789 could not be created in 1935 Davis was also of the view that providing for the general welfare of the aged was a power reserved to the states This sounds to us a lot like some of the arguments in the health care case  which revolves around the question of whether the federal government is justified in imposing a tax based penalty on Americans who refuse to sign up for health care coverage The high court handed down its decision on May 24  1937 Reflecting a divisive debate in Congress and among the justices  the Court upheld the unemployment insurance provision by a narrow  5 4 vote But in the old age insurance  the Roosevelt administration won a resounding 7 2 victory  without even a written dissent by the dissenters In his majority opinion in Helvering vs Davis  Justice Benjamin Cardozo wrote that the Great Depression was a national problem that demanded national solutions The ill is all one or at least not greatly different whether men are thrown out of work because there is no longer work to do or because the disabilities of age make them incapable of doing it  Cardozo wrote Rescue becomes necessary irrespective of the cause The hope behind this statute is to save men and women from the rigors of the poor house as well as from the haunting fear that such a lot awaits them when journeys end is near Paul Van de Water  a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities  said that Obama has a point that there are similarities between the legal battle over Social Security and the fight over the health care law Like the Affordable Care Act  the Social Security Act was subject to constitutional challenges  lower courts reached conflicting conclusions  and the issue was not resolved until the cases reached the Supreme Court  he said If the recent past is any guide  the court that eventually takes up the health care law  led by another Justice Roberts  will also be one with a close ideological divide Of course  there are limits to the comparison The fact that there are all kinds of lawsuits challenging X  which was eventually upheld  obviously does not mean that every other law that is challenged by all kinds of lawsuits will also be eventually upheld  said Stuart Taylor  a veteran commentator on the Supreme Court Taylor added that while many of the broader themes are similar  the specific legal arguments are not identical The issue at the heart of the health care individual mandate    whether the government can  in the name of regulating interstate commerce  require individuals to buy a commercial product simply because they were born and they live in this country    was raised neither by the Social Security cases nor by any other case in the nations history  Taylor said Also  while one can plausibly defend the individual mandates enforcement provision as a tax in support of the general welfare  like the Social Security tax  that argument is somewhat undermined by the facts that the President and Congress strenuously denied that the mandate is a tax in order to get it passed and that the law itself was changed to call it a penalty  not a tax So  Obamas comparison is not exact But there are some striking similarities  so    unlike in our previous item    we think the president was justified in making the broad comparison,0,0,1380,real

3281,2011-02-21T18:55:11-05:00,2011,abcnewsgocom,George Will,If Wisconsins governor cuts perquisites as much as he plans to do  it would still leave  workers  better off than their private sector counterparts,With national attention focused on a showdown in Wisconsin over Gov Scott Walkers proposal to reduce state worker benefits  the issue led to some spirited back and forth between union backer Donna Brazile and conservative columnist George Will during the round table discussion on ABCs This Week Brazile called the workers who have flooded the state capitol to back union workers an organic movement Just like the Tea Party went out there and grabbed the microphone  what you have is grassroots people out there saying  No more  no more budget cuts on the back of working people Brazile said Will responded  Donna  what you call the grassroots is a tiny minority of this tiny minority of Wisconsin people who work for the government Three hundred thousand public employees in Wisconsin went to work    while the teachers were clutching their little signs that say its all about the kids  theyre abandoning their classrooms  lying to their supervisors  saying they were sick  and going off to protest in defense of perquisites  which if the governor cuts them as much as he plans to do  would still leave them better off than their private sector counterparts We decided to check Wills claim that perks or non wage compensation such as health and retirement benefits     if cut as much as Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has proposed    would still leave public employees better off than those in the private sector Walkers plan would require state workers to pay 58 percent of their pension contributions and to double their share of health premiums to 126 percent Our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin have been all over many of the issues in this contentious debate  and back on Feb 8  they fact checked a claim Gov Walker made in his first state of the state address  that most state employees could pay twice as much toward their health care premiums  and it would still be half the national average Heres some of what our friends at PolitiFact Wisconsin found    A Kaiser Family Foundation study that concluded that employees nationally    public and private    pay an average of 29 percent of the cost of the premiums Among just state and government workers nationwide  the average was 25 percent for family coverage   A US Bureau of Labor Statistics 2010 health care benefits survey that put the employee share at 32 percent for family coverage Its 21 percent for single coverage   A study by The Segal Co   a private benefits firm  that looked just at state government workers and found that a majority pay between 20 percent and 60 percent of their premium costs for family coverage In other words  no matter how you slice it  the 126 percent share of health care premiums that Walker proposes employees pay is well below what most pay in the private    and public    sectors That gets us halfway there The second piece is pensions Again  Walkers plan would require state workers to pay 58 percent of pension contributions This one is a little more difficult to compare Most public employees have a pension plan But fewer than one in five private sector employees has access to a pension plan And those who do typically dont contribute anything to it Much more often  private employees have access to employer sponsored retirement benefits  such as 401 k  plans   rather than pensions And a third of the private sector workforce has no access to an employer sponsored retirement plan at all The 401 k  has become the de facto retirement benefit in the private sector  said Keith Brainard  research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators Typically  Brainard said  employers will match about 3 percent to 5 percent of an employees salary Employees may contribute to their 401 k   but they arent required to contribute So Wisconsin public employees may be required to contribute more to the their retirement plan than those in the private sector  but that doesnt mean theyre at a disadvantage compared to the private sector In fact  experts say they will be better off According to a survey prepared by Brainard in October 2009  The retirement security of working Americans presently appears shaky outside the public sector  due not only to the nations heavy use of a retirement plan model that has been found to be undependable in its ability to provide reliable retirement income  but also due to low relative rates of participation in employer sponsored retirement plans  Conversely  For most states and local governments  retirement security of retired workers is a policy that is being achieved As always  Brainard said  there are exceptions  such as for those government employees who dont work long enough to become vested in a pension But Wills comment  as it relates to pension is largely accurate  Brainard said Overall  the retirement plan typically provided to Wisconsin public employees   whether or not they are contributing 58 percent    provides a larger retirement benefit than private sector employees get Wed like to cite one more survey  one by the Wisconsin Legislative Council which found that even among major public employee retirement systems  most required employee contributions of more than 5 percent According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  for government workers with a required plan contribution  the average contribution is 63 percent of earnings So Walkers proposal is in line with the norm for government workers Now  wed like to drop one big disclaimer into this whole analysis Many experts contend that while state workers get better benefits  they get paid less than folks in the private sector PolitiFact Wisconsin took a closer look at that issue here  The point is that its important to consider an employees total package of wages and benefits when comparing public and private sector compensation But thats not the issue before us here Will clearly stated that he was talking about just the benefits side of the equation And with

And how have past Massachusetts governors treated electronic records? PolitiFact is on the case First  we took a look at Massachusetts public records law  The law  which requires state officials to preserve records for a set amount of time    is fairly clear about electronic records The Public Records Law applies to all government records generated  received or maintained electronically  including computer records  electronic mail  video and audiotapes  William Galvin  Secretary of the Commonwealth  wrote in a 2009 guide to the state law  But the Massachusetts governors office is not subject to these regulations  according to the state Supreme Court In 1997  the court issued a ruling that effectively exempts the governors office from the public records laws requirements In the ruling   Ann K Lambert vs Executive Director of the Judicial Nominating Council   the court determined that judicial nomination documents submitted to the states governor are not public because the governors office is not explicitly included in the state records law Were we to conclude that the public records law included the records   a conflict could arise between the legislation and the executive order which could impair the Governors ability to exercise his constitutional responsibility  the justices wrote In the years since  this decision hasnt stopped governors from submitting records to the state archives  according to former staff members  Both before and after the Lambert decision  administration staff members  including those under Romney  have submitted records to the state archives  according to Terry Dolan  who served as director of administration for six governors  including Romney  between 1985 and 2008 But to her recollection  none of the former governors    Michael Dukakis  William Weld  Paul Cellucci  Jane Swift nor Romney    have submitted electronic records to the archives Nor have state record keepers received any  according to Brian McNiff  a spokesman for the Secretary of the Commonwealth  who oversees the public records division  As they left office  each of the governors submitted hundreds of boxes of paper records to the records center  said Dolan  who now works at Northeastern Universitys Dukakis Center for Urban and Regional Policy The only electronic records and communications that were included were when the governors staff included printouts of some of them  she said McNiff  of the Secretary of the Commonwealths office  said records submitted from the Romney administration included print outs of electronic records It would be tough to track how many  but its safe to say e mail printouts do not make up the bulk of material  McNiff wrote in an e mail As for whether governors leave records for incoming administrations  Dolan said staff members routinely passed along some documents  both electronic and physical  which may prove valuable to the incoming governor Some records  including those involving ongoing legislation  legal cases and gubernatorial appointments  extended into the following administration  she said  and governors  including Romney  passed those along to their successors But  aside from those  staffers generally cleared all staff computers of past records during the transition period  Dolan said That was the routine  she said Computers to the best of my recollection would be re imaged and old files deleted between administrations  You wouldnt just start up your computer and find files waiting there,2,0,706,real

We decided to check his record What he said The Washington Times story cited in the ad was about Romneys May visit to a Philadelphia charter school He joined a roundtable of teachers and talked about his approach to education while governor of Massachusetts I came into office and talked to people  and saidWhat do we do to improve our schools? And a number of folks said Well  we need smaller classroom sizes    that will make the biggest difference So I gathered information across our state We had 351 cities and towns I said lets compare the average classroom size from each school district with the performance of our students  because we test our kids  and well see if theres a relationship And there was not As a matter of fact  the school district with the smallest classrooms  Cambridge  had students in the bottom 10 percent  he continued So just getting smaller classrooms didnt seem to be the key A teacher asked Romney for his views on class size He mentioned work by the consulting firm McKinsey Global Institute comparing class size and student performance among several countries Romney said the study found that in schools that are the highest performing in the world  their classroom sizes are about the same as in the United States So its not the classroom size thats driving the success of those school systems He said factors such as parent involvement  motivated teachers and quality administrators were better drivers of success Romney often cites McKinseys research His campaign pointed us to similar remarks Romney made in Orlando last September and in Nashua  NH in November I plotted the one versus the other  classroom size against student performance And guess what? There was no relationship at all  he said in Orlando The Obama campaign also cited his speech in The Villages  a retirement town in central Florida Romney said Massachusetts data showed that classroom size was not relevant in my state to how well the kids were doing Finally  on page 216 of his book No Apology  Romney wrote  in the United States  then  the effort to reduce classroom size may actually hurt education more than it helps Romneys campaign website makes no mention of class size but touts the importance of school choice and expanding access to high quality public charter schools His campaign spokesman  Ryan Williams  pointed out that Obamas education secretary  Arne Duncan  has also expressed skepticism about the emphasis on small classes,3,0,561,real

4080,2011-07-08T16:07:55-04:00,2011,frwebgate2accessgpogov,John Cornyn,Fifty one percent    that is  a majority of American households    paid no income tax in 2009 Zero Zip Nada,In a July 7  2011  floor speech   Sen John Cornyn  R Texas  offered a striking statistic about how few American households pay federal income taxes Lets talk about federal tax reform  he said  referring to suggestions that a restructuring of the tax code could emerge from bipartisan negotiations over extending the federal governments ability to borrow money There has been a lot of discussion about that  where we want to take the tax code with all of its multiple provisions and get it on the table and take a look at it to make sure it is  in my view  flatter  fairer and simpler But right now  the fact  is  that according to the Committee on Joint Taxation  51 percent    that is  a majority of American households    paid no income tax in 2009 Zero Zip Nada  Actually  to show how out of whack things have gotten  30 percent of American households actually made money from the tax system by way of refundable tax credits    the Earned Income Tax Credit  among others So 51 percent of American households paid no income tax in 2009  but 30 percent actually made money under the current system In a sign that this is becoming a Republican talking point  Cornyns comments echoed those made on the floor the same day by Sen Orrin Hatch  R Utah So  is it true that a majority of Americans arent paying any federal income tax? The answer is that Cornyn is correct And the backstory is interesting As Cornyn noted  his statistics come from a document produced by the Joint Committee on Taxation  a respected bipartisan committee of Congress The JCT found that for tax year 2009  roughly 22 percent of tax units  not exactly households  but well give Cornyn a pass on the terminology  ended up without any tax liability Another 30 percent got money back from the government  through mechanisms such as the Earned Income Tax Credit  a longstanding policy that encourages low income Americans to work by refunding money through the tax code By contrast  JCT found just 49 percent of Americans owed anything to the government How did we get to the point where most Americans dont pay federal income taxes? Our colleagues at PolitiFact Virginia explained it a few months ago while checking a similar claim by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor  R Va The main reason is that the US employs the tax system not just to collect funds but to distribute them as well Bob Williams  a tax policy specialist at the nonpartisan Urban Institute Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center  said this is largely carried out through popular tax breaks  which are sometimes called tax expenditures There are lots and lots of them  he said We estimate they total more than a trillion dollars a year in reduced taxes  and in fact the bulk of those go to the top end of the income distribution However  because high earners have so much income liability  the breaks they get still dont lower their taxes to zero By contrast  popular lower  and middle income breaks such as child credits and mortgage interest deductions do get a big share of the population off the hook Concern about the wisdom of providing so many tax expenditures is one of the reasons why some are calling for fundamentally restructuring the tax code  perhaps as part of the ongoing debt ceiling negotiations A tax code that included fewer specialized exemptions and deductions would enable basic tax rates to fall for all tax brackets As an added benefit  the tax code would become simpler We should note that Cornyn worded his statement carefully enough to avoid potential pitfalls Here are a few of them  Cornyn made clear that he meant 2009 The percentage of households with no tax liability bounces around quite a bit year by year  partly due to changes in the tax code and partly due to changing economic conditions Figures from the Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center show that since 2004  the percentage of no liability tax units has been as low as 399 percent in 2007 In fact  2009    the year Cornyn cited    may prove to be a high point The centers projections suggest that the rate could fall to 495 percent for tax year 2010 and 464 percent in 2011 Cornyn took care to refer to households that pay no income tax  rather than suggesting that they paid no taxes at all Many Americans who pay no income tax pay other federal taxes  most notably the payroll tax  which funds Social Security and Medicare and is deducted from every working Americans paycheck Estimates by the Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center project that for tax year 2011  464 percent of households wont have any income tax liability However  of this number  283 percent will pay payroll taxes  the center projects Of the remaining 181 percent with neither income nor payroll tax liability  103 percent are elderly and 69 percent are not elderly but have incomes lower than  20 000 In other words  all but a tiny sliver of Americans without either income tax or payroll tax liability are either elderly or poor Some families who pay no federal income tax may be liable for state income taxes  and local property taxes  sales taxes and the like  But Cornyn began his remarks by talking about federal tax reform  so we wont fault him for not mentioning that There are enough different ways to look at the tax burden to allow all sides to pick and choose tax statistics that favor their positions Conservatives have a point that richer Americans pay the lions share of federal taxes In 2007  according to the Urban Brookings Center   the richest 20 percent paid 689 percent of federal taxes  and the top 1 percent paid 281 percent  One would expect the rich to pay more  since they earn more  but these percentages are even higher than their share of the nations total income According to one frequently cited academic study   the top 20 percent earned 614 percent of income in 2006 and the top 1 percent earned 213 percent of income that same year  In addition  the richest 10 percent  5 percent and 1 percent of taxpayers each paid significantly higher effective tax rates than Americans lower on the income spectrum On the other hand  PolitiFact rated as Mostly True a recent statement by President Barack Obama that if youre a  wealthy CEO or a  hedge fund manager in America right now  your taxes are  lower than theyve been since the 1950s And by international standards  the US tax burden remains modest  In other words  scoring points on tax policy depends on how you frame the issue So where does this leave us? A full understanding of US tax policy requires a lot of additional context that Cornyn didnt supply Still  at PolitiFact  words matter  and on the specific point Cornyn was making    that a majority of American households paid no income tax in 2009    he not only accurately cited a credible study but also took care to cite a specific year and to explain that he only meant to refer to federal income taxes,3,0,1194,real

4306,2011-08-18T12:01:21-04:00,2011,wwwnytimescom,Warren Buffett,The mega rich pay about 15 percent in taxes  while the middle class fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets  and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot,Its not often you see someone stand up and say  Tax me more! Yet thats just what famed investor Warren Buffett has done in an op ed in the New York Times headlined   Stop Coddling the Super Rich  Buffett says that very wealthy people like himself pay lower tax rates than the middle class  thanks to special tax categories for investment income While the poor and middle class fight for us in Afghanistan  and while most Americans struggle to make ends meet  we mega rich continue to get our extraordinary tax breaks  he writes As an example  Buffett said he paid an effective tax rate of 174 percent  while people who worked in his office made much less but paid higher effective tax rates of between 33 percent and 41 percent  averaging 36 percent If you make money with money  as some of my super rich friends do  your percentage may be a bit lower than mine But if you earn money from a job  your percentage will surely exceed mine   most likely by a lot  Buffett wrote To understand why  you need to examine the sources of government revenue Last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes The mega rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes Its a different story for the middle class  typically  they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets  and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot Buffetts op ed inspired a reader to write to us and ask how Buffetts numbers could be correct As our previous fact checks have shown  about half of all Americans pay no federal income taxes because they are low income And when you analyze who pays the bulk of federal income taxes  its people with higher incomes  So we decided to fact check Buffetts statement that the mega rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes   The middle class  fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets  and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot Before we get to the heart of the fact check  its best if we review a few basics of the tax code that Buffetts op ed takes for granted This review proves the point that the federal tax code is extremely complicated  so bear with us Income taxes Federal income taxes are progressive  which means your income is taxed at higher rates as you make more money Lets take a married couple filing jointly as an example In 2011   after deductions and exemptions    the income between  0 and  17 000 is taxed at 10 percent    the income between  17 000 and  69 000 is taxed at 15 percent    the income between  69 000 and  139 350 is taxed at 25 percent    the income between  139 350 and  212 300 is taxed at 28 percent    the income between  212 300 and  379 150 is taxed at 33 percent    the income above  379 150 is taxed at 35 percent Keep in mind that even if youre in the top bracket of 35 percent  you dont pay that tax rate on all your income You pay 10 percent on the first  17 000  15 percent on the money between  17 000 and  69 000  and so on Payroll taxes Payroll taxes are separate from income taxes If you work for a company  your employer deducts the payroll taxes before you get your paycheck and sends the money on to the federal government These taxes pay for Social Security and Medicare  its listed as FICA on your pay stub Typically  workers pay 62 percent of their first  106 800 in earnings for Social Security taxes  and they pay 145 percent on all their earnings for Medicare hospital coverage The employer has to match those taxes  bringing total contributions on behalf of an individual to 124 percent for Social Security and 29 percent for Medicare Last year  though  President Barack Obama and Congress knocked 2 percentage points off Social Security taxes for workers  as an economic stimulus measure So this year  most of us are paying 42 percent while employers pay 62 percent Oh  and if youre self employed  you typically have to pay your share and the employer share for totals this year of 104 percent on earnings up to  106 800 and 29 percent on all income Payroll taxes are not progressive    the rates dont get higher the more you earn In the case of the Social Security taxes  which disappear once your reach a certain level of earnings  the percentage actually gets smaller if your income is higher than the  106 800 cap Head hurt yet? Ours  too Taxes on investments Okay  now were getting closer to Buffetts main point here  and thats taxes on investments The tax rates on investments tend to be lower than taxes on regular income If you make money buying and selling stocks or receiving dividends from stock ownership  those earnings are generally taxed at 15 percent  the rate for long term capital gains and qualified dividends Some hedge fund managers and other finance sector executives get taxed at this rate on their earnings because their compensation is classified as carried interest and taxed as a capital gain  The Wall Street Journal breaks down how carried interest works   In fact  some economists believe that the lower rates for capital gains actually encourages tax dodges  because it motivates high earners to look for ways to classify normal income as capital gains Defenders say the lower tax rate helps the economy because it rewards investors for risk taking and entrepreneurship They also argue that taxing dividends amounts to double taxation because corporations pay taxes on their income before investors are paid dividends We wont settle the argument here  but theres no doubt that investors get lower tax rates on their income than workers Getting back to Buffetts op ed  his claims rest on how these taxes interact with each other The fact were checking here is that the mega rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes  while middle class taxpayers fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets  and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot Hes right that a billionaire whose income is mostly from investments is probably taxed at a lower rate than someone who has an ordinary job Very little of this taxpayers income is wage income  so payroll taxes dont take much of a bite It seems likely that much of this hypothetical persons income would be taxed around the 15 percent rate And  in fact  as Buffett says  statistics from the Internal Revenue Service show that the 400 wealthiest taxpayers pay tax rates of less than 20 percent  On the other side of the equation  people who work for a living  especially those who make higher than average salaries  get taxed at higher rates It gets a little complicated  given how the tax brackets work  but basically  people who make between  100 000 and  200 000 are paying around 20 percent in income taxes  and it goes up from there  according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center  Buffett slightly glosses over the fact that if youre in the 25 percent tax bracket  your overall tax rate is less than 25 percent And  the more money you make  the more income taxes you pay  while payroll taxes seem less and less significant as a percentage of income Were dubious someone would pay as high as a 41 percent tax rate  as Buffett claims someone in his office now pays  The top income tax rate is 35 percent  but payroll taxes as a share of income decline as income rises  which makes it difficult to get above 379 percent  according to the people we ran this by at the Tax Policy Center  We contacted Buffetts offices as Berkshire Hathaway about this point but didnt hear back One final note  People who dont pay any income tax at all tend to have limited incomes  or they qualify for enough deductions    think of child tax credits and mortgage interest    that they have no income When Buffett talks about people in the middle class who pay more taxes than he does  hes thinking of people who make much higher than average salaries So when it comes to Buffetts statement  there are two categories  the rich and the really rich And the evidence tends to point to the conclusion that the really rich pay less in taxes as a percentage of income then their merely well to do counterparts    if their income comes primarily from investments,1,1,1484,real

McCain said Everybody goes! Theyve been selling out for years We wondered if McCain was right that Mamma Mia!  the musical based on ABBAs recordings  has been selling out for years First  we will assume that McCain was referring to the stage version  which has been playing on Broadway since 2001  not the movie version  which opened this summer The Broadway shows Web site says the stage production  which has been performed in eight languages  has been seen by more than 30 million people in over 170 cities The Web site calls it the ultimate feel good show And McCain seems to be keeping up with Broadway box office receipts TicketNews  which tracks Broadway receipts  reports that Mamma Mia! is still selling out For example  it sold out its performances the weeks ending Aug 3 and Aug 10  selling about 101 percent of its seats  the number exceeds 100 because it includes standing room tickets  A survey of other weeks in the past year found the show nearly sold out or exceeded capacity Alfred Branch Jr  news editor of TicketNews  told us that the show is a virtual sellout most nights So McCain is right that Mamma Mia has been selling out for years This claim is True,1,4,322,real

6173,2012-06-28T17:19:57-04:00,2012,twittercom,Sarah Palin,Obama said  the individual mandate  wasnt a tax,Moments after the Supreme Court ruled that it was largely upholding President Barack Obamas health care law  Republicans zeroed in on the courts decision to allow the individual mandate because it is enforced through a tax One of the Republicans to speak out was former Alaska Gov Sarah Palin  the partys 2008 vice presidential nominee After the courts decision was announced on June 28  2012  Palin tweeted   Obama lied to the American people Again He said it wasnt a tax Obama lies  freedom dies We arent able to fact check whether freedom is dying  which is solidly in the realm of opinion However  we can check her claim that Obama said the individual mandate  a requirement that people buy health insurance or face a tax penalty  wasnt a tax That was the basis for the courts decision to uphold the law Did Obama say the individual mandate wasnt a tax? Given how unpopular taxes are  its understandable why Obama would not trumpet the notion that the mandate was a tax  But has he said it was not a tax? We could find only one example after Obama was president in which he or a top aide explicitly stated that the mandate wasnt a tax  When we asked  the Republican National Committee couldnt come up with any other examples  either  The one instance came on Sept 20  2009  in an interview with ABCs George Stephanopoulos Heres an excerpt   Stephanopoulos  Under this mandate  the government is forcing people to spend money  fining you if you dont How is that not a tax? Obama  Well  hold on a second  George Here   heres whats happening You and I are both paying  900  on average   our families   in higher premiums because of uncompensated care Now what Ive said is that if you cant afford health insurance  you certainly shouldnt be punished for that Thats just piling on If  on the other hand  were giving tax credits  weve set up an exchange  you are now part of a big pool  weve driven down the costs  weve done everything we can and you actually can afford health insurance  but youve just decided  you know what  I want to take my chances And then you get hit by a bus and you and I have to pay for the emergency room care  thats Stephanopoulos  That may be  but its still a tax increase Obama  No Thats not true  George The   for us to say that youve got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase What its saying is  is that were not going to have other people carrying your burdens for you anymore than the fact that right now everybody in America  just about  has to get auto insurance Nobody considers that a tax increase People say to themselves  that is a fair way to make sure that if you hit my car  that Im not covering all the costs Stephanopoulos  But it may be fair  it may be good public policy Obama  No  but   but  George  you   you cant just make up that language and decide that thats called a tax increase  What if I say that right now your premiums are going to be going up by 5 or 8 or 10 percent next year and you say well  thats not a tax increase  but  on the other hand  if I say that I dont want to have to pay for you not carrying coverage even after I give you tax credits that make it affordable  then Stephanopoulos  I dont think Im making it up Merriam Websters Dictionary  Tax   a charge  usually of money  imposed by authority on persons or property for public purposes Obama  George  the fact that you looked up Merriams Dictionary  the definition of tax increase  indicates to me that youre stretching a little bit right now Otherwise  you wouldnt have gone to the dictionary to check on the definition I mean what Stephanopoulos  I wanted to check for myself But your critics say it is a tax increase Obama  My critics say everything is a tax increase My critics say that Im taking over every sector of the economy You know that Look  we can have a legitimate debate about whether or not were going to have an individual mandate or not  but Stephanopoulos  But you reject that its a tax increase? Obama  I absolutely reject that notion Sliced up into brief sound bites  the back and forth between Stephanopoulos offers some clear evidence of Obama arguing that the mandate is not a tax  most obviously when he says that the mandate is absolutely not a tax increase Still  its worth noting that Obama made the case that the alternative was worse    that not having an individual mandate would be unfair and inefficient The absence of an individual mandate  Obama argued  means passing on the costs of treating Americans uninsured to people who are insured  which amounts to a tax on those with coverage  even though it may not be literally fit the dictionary definition of a tax In essence  Obama was brushing off complaints that he was imposing a tax by contending that a tax was already in place under the status quo,4,0,869,real

The ad shows grisly video footage  low flying aircraft with gunners leaning out the door shooting wolves and bears from the air The plane later lands and the shooter finalizes the kill In one picture  a wolfs carcass hangs from one of the planes wing braces For this item  well focus on the claim that Palin promotes aerial hunting of wolves and other wildlife Palins record on the issue is actually quite clear As a candidate  and as governor  the Republican has endorsed wildlife management practices that include the controversial use of airplanes to thin out predator populations But in Alaska  frontier politics look different than they do in the Lower 48 Alaska has vast populations of wolves  bears  caribou and moose  and sportsmen who hunt and sometimes live off those species  If I am elected  I dont want you to be surprised that I am a proponent of predator control in order to build those populations of moose and caribou   Palin said  according to news reports from a gubernatorial debate in 2006 Alaska state officials take issue with the use of the phrase  aerial hunting   preferring  aerial shooting   The predator control program that we do   that isnt hunting and we never claimed it is   said Tim Barry  spokesman for the Alaska Department of Fish   Game  It deliberately gives hunters an unfair advantage Thats what we want  Its tougher to assess the ads subjective assessment that such practices are  brutal and unethical   though many wildlife groups would agree Defenders of Wildlife has filed lawsuits challenging Alaskas wildlife management practices President Rodger Schlickeisen said his group takes the view that any killing of animals  outside of a biological emergency  is unwarranted In September 2007  more than 120 scientists signed a letter to Palin that questioned the biological basis for the states intensive predator management Aerial hunting has been banned since 1972 in every state but Alaska  which gets around the federal law by claiming that predator population control is more important The ad is missing an important note of context Unlike other areas around the United States where wolf populations are smaller  Alaska officials count between 7 000 and 11 000 in the state Wolf populations are managed in five parts of the state as part of a program that began in 2003 under former Gov Frank Murkowski In 2007  Palins administration proposed enhancements to encourage hunters to kill more wolves when it became clear that not enough wolves were being taken out of the population to meet the states goal for the year Palins office announced a plan to pay hunters  150 for each wolf killed with the money to be paid when hunters turned in the left foreleg of dead wolves to state biologists The program was axed by a judge who ruled it an improper bounty on wildlife  I have said many times that my administration is committed to management of game for abundance  and to a proactive  science based predator management program where appropriate   the governor said in a news release at the time,1,0,670,real

Ryan  What I would say on doing away with it  is who would we do away with it for And what were saying is the people who disproportionately use those  its the top two tax rate payers use almost of those tax expenditures We would limit these things to those higher income earners Wallace  Even things like the deduction for health insurance and pensions and home mortgage? Ryan  Yes  right Instead of giving these write offs to the people in the top tax bracket  take those tax shelters away For every dollar thats parked in the tax shelter is taxed at zero Take away the tax shelter  subject all of their income to taxation  you get more revenue  and we can lower everybodys tax rate in return So  were saying lets limit these kinds of deductions to the higher income earners so that everybody can enjoy lower  flatter tax rates in return,2,0,833,real

Wolfe asked Wolfe said a  1 000 rebate would help many struggling families buy time to transition to the higher costs,1,0,596,real

It would mean a cut of more than 20 percent in Medicare benefits next year If you count on Medicare  it would mean fewer places to get care and less freedom to choose your own doctors Youll pay more for your drugs Youll receive fewer services Youll get lower quality care I dont think thats right In fact  it aint right  Cheers  When youve worked hard your whole life and pay into the system and done everything right  you shouldnt have the carpet pulled out from under you when you least expect it and can least afford it An ad  and ensuing criticism Back in 2008  the Obama campaign released a television ad making the same basic claim How would your golden years turn out under John McCain? the announcer said in the 2008 ad His health care plan would cut Medicare by  800 billion That means a 22 percent cut in benefits Higher premiums and co pays More expensive prescription drugs Nursing home care could suffer  After a lifetime of work  seniors health care shouldnt be a gamble John McCains plan? Its not the change we need PolitiFact examined the claim from Obamas speech about McCains Medicare plan and rated it False  McCain has never talked about Medicare benefit and service cuts to pay for his health care plan Instead  his campaign says it would achieve the necessary cost savings by overhauling Medicare reimbursement policies  streamlining treatments for certain chronic diseases  cracking down on fraud and waste  expanding the use of lower cost generic drugs and assorted other steps  we wrote While not the same in every detail  McCains ideas for cost savings sound an awful lot like the ones Obama has pursued as president The New York Times was similarly critical of the 2008 ad  saying it  does mischaracterize Mr McCains plan by stitching together vague language from a news report with back of the envelope calculations by a partisan policy group,3,0,653,real

It turns out Biden  with the majority of Senate Democrats  did oppose a 1991 congressional resolution authorizing the use of force following Saddam Husseins invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 The question of whether to commit troops was the first decision the 102nd Congress faced upon convening in January 1991 In spite of diplomatic initiatives that followed Iraqs invasion  the elements of a major war were in place by Jan 1  nearly 1 million troops poised along either side of Kuwaits border with Saudi Arabia  the UN authorization for member nations to use any means necessary to secure Iraqs removal after Jan 15  and Husseins unwavering position that he would hold on to his conquest Congress was put in the position of making a firm and formal stand Democratic leaders spurned President George HW Bushs request for an open ended vote of support and urged members to delay any action on the crisis  lest it undermine a final attempt at a diplomatic solution Nonetheless  the Senate began debate on Jan 4 On Jan 12  a sharply divided Congress authorized the president to go to war   the first time since World War II that Congress directly confronted the issue of sending large numbers of American troops into combat The joint resolution authorized the president to use United States Armed Forces to enforce a Nov 29  1990  UN Security Council ultimatum that Iraq withdraw troops from Kuwait The resolution put no time limit on the use of American force if Iraq failed to live up to the UN imposed conditions The Senate voted 52 47 to authorize the use of force  with Biden among those voting no Ten Democrats joined with virtually unanimous Republicans in support of the resolution Minutes later  the House approved identical legislation by a vote of 250 183 Most of the Democratic opponents argued that war should be only a last resort  and insisted that the administration and its allies should have waited months   and maybe as long as a year   on the expectation that the pressure from economic sanctions would eventually force Iraq to withdraw That view was endorsed by some scholars and former Pentagon officials who had testified before congressional committees  but was emphatically disputed by others As the vote approached  Biden expressed concern about the United States bearing an undue burden of the military operations  and derided other nations in the anti Iraq coalition  calling it  a coalition that has allowed us to take on 95 percent of the sacrifice across the board The vote represented the thinnest congressional margin backing military action since the War of 1812 And senators split the same way on a resolution offered prior to the use of force measure by Majority Leader George J Mitchell of Maine and Armed Services Committee chairman Sam Nunn  D Ga  that demanded a continued reliance on economic sanctions That resolution was defeated 46 53  with Biden voting in favor On the campaign trail  Biden makes the case that he has the requisite toughness to go head to head with foreign leaders As an example  he points to a 1993 encounter with Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic duiring the Balkan wars in which he called Milosevic a war criminal to his face But Bidens two votes on the eve of war in 1991 clearly show he favored continued economic sanctions over the use of military force For this reason  we rule Grahams statement True,1,0,731,real

War in 1990 1991,Shortly after the launch of air and missile attacks against Libya by an international alliance that included the United States  journalist Robin Wright sought to provide television viewers with some context for understanding the coalition of nations opposing Moammar Gadhafi  the alliances target During a roundtable segment on the March 20  2011  edition of ABCs This Week with Christiane Amanpour  the host asked Wright    a veteran diplomatic correspondent whos now a scholar at the US Institute of Peace    whether Gadhafi is crazy and how secure his hold on power is He could prolong this for a very long time  Wright said This is not a man who plays by international rules  nor is he a man who thinks like even many of his counterparts in the Arab world  and thats why I think youve seen a great deal of unity in the Arab world against him  Amanpour interjected  Which is really unusual  to have such a big Arab coalition against a fellow Arab leader Wright agreed  saying  And we havent had one like this since the Iraq war back in 1990 1991 And thats whats  in fact  given the international community the legs Without that  we probably would not be engaged We wondered whether Wright was correct about the scope of Arab support for these alliances So we looked into it The Persian Gulf War The Persian Gulf War was waged to eject Iraqi troops from Kuwait  which had been invaded by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in August 1990 Thanks in large part to the diplomacy of then President George HW Bush  a broad  international coalition was brought to bear against Hussein  and by the end of February 1991  allied troops had succeeded in pushing Iraqi troops out of Kuwait Troops from several Arab states took part in ground combat  notably Egypt  Syria  Kuwait and Saudi Arabia Several smaller states along the Persian Gulf also took part in the war either in combat roles or by providing logistics or base support    Bahrain   Morocco   Oman   Qatar and the United Arab Emirates The main exception among major Arab states was Jordan  which sided with Iraq The Iraq War The next major conflict involving an Arab leader was the Iraq War  launched in 2003 by President George W Bush with the aim of toppling Hussein  who had remained in power despite the 1990 1991 war This conflict proved much more controversial internationally  and the Bush administration had little success signing up Arab support Scott Althaus and Kalev Leetaru of the University of Illinois  at Urbana Champaign have recorded in great detail the shifting membership of the coalition of the willing    the younger Bushs list of Iraq War supporters  but we could only find one Arab nation on the list  Kuwait Libya Following a wave of popular uprisings against entrenched leaders across the Arab world  rebellion sprang up in Libya  which had been ruled for decades by Gadhafi The rebels scored some quick victories  but by mid March  forces loyal to Gadhafi began to gain back lost territory Fears of wider bloodshed rose  and international diplomacy kicked into high gear On March 12  2011  the Arab League    a group of nearly two dozen Arab nations that recently suspended Libyas membership    urged the United Nations to establish a no fly zone aimed at crippling Gadhafis ability to strike the rebels from the air On March 17  2011  the UN Security Council complied  and the US  France and the United Kingdom drew up military plans Attacks began on March 19 In addition to the Arab Leagues support for the mission  at least two Arab nations    Qatar and the United Arab Emirates    have reportedly pledged tangible military assistance On March 21  Al Jazeera reported that a French military spokesman had said that four Qatari jets were expected to take part in operations against Gadhafi In addition  there are unconfirmed news reports that Egypt is letting arms shipments into the rebels in neighboring eastern Libya  but the Egyptian government    which is in a transitional status following the ouster of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak in a popular revolution earlier this year    has not made any official pledges of military support Our conclusion Wright is correct that the Libya campaign represents the largest alignment of Arab states against a fellow Arab leader since the Persian Gulf War of 1990 1991 However  the significance of this fact is the subject of some debate For starters  support for the Libyan situation is in flux Just days after calling for the no fly zone  the head of the Arab League  Amr Moussa  backtracked somewhat by expressing reservations about the risks of civilian deaths in the initial round of attacks Later  in comments to reporters in Cairo  he reaffirmed support for the coalitions efforts Meanwhile  it remains to be seen whether more Arab nations will join the effort individually    and whether troops take as significant a role in the Libyan operations as Arab troops did during the Persian Gulf War In other words  its very early in the process  and Arab support could dissipate On the other hand  even if the extent of military assistance by Arab states proves to be limited  experts told PolitiFact that the political and diplomatic consequences so far are by themselves notable I think Robins point is that Arab states have not lined up together  militarily or politically  against a fellow Arab leader like this since 1991  said Tom Malinowski  Washington director for Human Rights Watch They could have done so in other cases   in Sudan over Darfur  for example  or against Gadhafi at various points in the past  or even against Mubarak earlier this year But they didnt  and now they have And I wouldnt say thats trivial Stephen McInerney  executive director of the Project on Middle East Democracy  agreed  saying that the difference between the lack of Arab support for the Iraq War and the support for the situation in Libya is extremely significant The full history of this

he told Russian broadcaster RT   which the US government considers a Kremlin propaganda outlet An op ed with the headline Trump is right  fake news is the enemy  something China has known for years ran in May in the Peoples Daily  the official newspaper of the Communist Party in China  which is perennially a leading jailer of journalists Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in October said he had been  demonized  through  fake news  coverage of his brutal drug war  which has seen an unprecedented scale of extrajudicial killings  according to Human Rights Watch  At a joint press appearance in Manila in November  with Trump laughing at his side   Duterte called journalists spies Trumps rebranding offake news Theres reason to think Trump inspired these responses He has helped to popularize the phrase fake news  while shifting its meaning According to CNN   Trump has used the word fake more than 400 times since his inauguration  including fake news and its variants Overall  use of the phrase fake news across all forms of media increased 365 percent from November 2016 to November 2017  according to the Collins Dictionary   which named fake news its 2017 word of the year At PolitiFact  we have used the term fake news to refer to fabricated content masquerading as a portrayal of actual events  naming it our 2016 Lie of the Year after made up stories dominated social media during the presidential election Trump  however  uses fake news to dismiss coverage that is unsympathetic to him and his administration  or as a criticism against entire news organizations Hes also taken credit for rebranding the term fake news to apply to fact based journalism  calling it one of the greatest of all terms Ive come up with The epithets authoritarian appeal Experts said its easy to see why Trumps use of the term fake news appeals to authoritarian leaders Authoritarian governments are typified by highly centralized power and the predominance of the state over individual rights Every authoritarian needs to spread his own version of reality  and will invest time and resources to discredit anyone elses  said Ruth Ben Ghiat  a history professor at New York University Many of them are corrupt  and if an investigation threatens to compromise their authority  or charges of wrongdoing come down  they need the public to believe only what they say Ben Ghiat said Trumps consistent efforts to attack the press as purveyors of bias and lies against him  and incite hostility toward individual news outlets and journalists  can be seen as part of a larger campaign against sectors of society that value evidence and investigation When Trump saysI am the only one who matters it is not just self glorification  but a message about whose version of the facts should count in America  she said How can foreign rulers not feel empowered by this? A First Amendment advocate we spoke to drew parallels between Trumps use of the term fake news and George Orwells dystopian novel 1984  in which an authoritarian state inverts language to mean the opposite of its literal definition It is a characteristic of authoritarian leaders  whether Communist or Nazi  to appropriate ordinary words and declare them to mean the opposite  Bruce Johnson  a Seattle based media lawyer  told PolitiFact Repressive regimes hold power by depriving their population of independent thinking and making the masses believe lies Its worth noting we found no mentions of fake news from foreign leaders before 2016 Increased risk to journalists The rise of the fake news epithet coincided with one of the most dangerous years for journalists Last year  the Committee to Protect Journalists found 262 journalists were jailed for their work  a historic high for the second year in a row In 21 cases  journalists were jailed under false news statutes  more than double the number in 2016  and in more countries  said Courtney Radsch  advocacy director at Committee to Protect Journalists Its created an environment where its more permissive for governments to jail journalists on false news charges  she said They certainly dont think theyre going to face many repercussions or condemnation from the United States when you have the president making those comments on a regular basis Human rights activists say the growing disregard for facts has been making their job harder  too Political leaders around the world have begun to deploy the labelfake news as a smear on fact finding by journalists  human rights organizations  perhaps even prosecutors  wrote Iain Levine of Human Rights Watch In doing so  they seek to break the link between evidence and culpability  making it more difficult to ensure those accountable pay for their misdeeds,2,0,1108,real

8045,2013-07-19T11:46:09-04:00,2013,wwwcqcom,Tom Cole,Food stamp spending doubled under President Bush  doubled again under President Obama,Food stamp spending doubled under President Barack Obama   after doubling under his Republican predecessor  says Rep Tom Cole  R Okla Thats one reason hes disappointed that House lawmakers missed a chance to push for more than  20 billion in savings over 10 years when they stripped nutrition programs from the farm bill  Now they may be stuck with current law or the Senate bill   he said  which aims to trim about  4 billion  I would argue what we missed  as Republicans  was the chance for real reform  he said in an  MSNBC interview July 16  2013 We could have gotten some reductions Its a program thats doubled under President  George W  Bush  doubled again under President Obama So  you know  program this big  theres some things you can do differently and still help people that need it We wondered  Did such spending double under Bush  then double again? SNAP growth Well start by noting that food stamps have officially been known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  or SNAP  since October 2008 Its the federal governments largest food program  eclipsing other big farm bill food spending for school lunches and breakfasts and for Women  Infants and Children It helps low income people buy groceries  usually with benefit cards that work like debit cards The 2007 09 recession drove the number of folks on food stamps to a record high under Obama In an average month in 2011  one in seven US residents got help A Washington Post reporter this year documented one Rhode Island towns reliance on its monthly SNAP infusion We asked Cole for his evidence that spending doubled under Bush before doubling under Obama The congressman provided numbers from the agency that administers the program  the US Agriculture Department He compared total costs of the program from the start of Bushs term in 2000 to the end of his second term in 2008  then growth from 2008 to the most recent fiscal year available  2012 Costs had more than doubled under Bush  from  17 billion to  38 billion  then doubled again under Obama  to  78 billion Cole didnt adjust for inflation  but he should have  A more accurate inflation adjusted measure even more closely matches his claim Total spending on SNAP in 2012 dollars doubled under Bush  from  20 billion to  40 billion  and very nearly doubled under Obama   40 billion to  78 billion Why? The story since 2007 is still fresh  joblessness driven by the recession made more people eligible for help  and also drove more folks who were already eligible for help to ask for it  perhaps because their other support networks were tapped out The stimulus bill also included a boost in benefits  which temporarily increased costs That expires in November The recession also partly explains the rise in benefits before Bush left office in 2008 But it was the presidency of Bill Clinton and the 1996 welfare reform that set the stage for rising benefits under Bush Under Clinton  spending had fallen nearly 40 percent  partly because of new limits in the law By the late 1990s  lawmakers were already starting to roll back some restrictions  according to the Congressional Budget Office  The increases were largely a rebound from the deep cuts the program sustained in the 1996 welfare law and strengthening the programs ability to support working families  said Dottie Rosenbaum  who worked in the Congressional Budget Office at the time Shes now a senior policy analyst with the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities Ron Haskins  a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who advised Bush on welfare policy at the time of the 2002 farm bill  said the goal then was to expand food programs for low income working families The bill made it easier for states to administer the programs and to get more eligible people signed up If theyre willing to work for 9 or 10 bucks an hour  and get our kids out of poverty  then we ought to help them  he said He said hes concerned by the increase in spending on food stamps  and has testified before Congress on ways to reduce it  including requiring more evidence for families to claim deductions that help them qualify for benefits Rosenbaum argues no change is required Spending will come down on its own as the economy recovers About 65 percent of the growth in spending from 2007 to 2011 was driven by an increase in the number of people eligible for food stamps in the poor economy  according to the Congressional Budget Office About 20 percent of growth came from the temporarily higher benefits under the stimulus bill In other words  the economy by itself will bring food stamp spending down The more recent growth is driven primarily by the recession and is evidence that SNAP is doing precisely what it is designed to do  quickly help more low income families during economic downturns as poverty rises  unemployment mounts  and more people need assistance  she said,2,0,829,real

Voting to give illegal aliens Social Security benefits  tax breaks and college tuition  voting against declaring English our national language twice and even siding with Obama and the president of Mexico to block Arizonas tough new immigration law Harry Reidits clear whose side hes on  and its not yours In a fact check of a previous campaign ad   we dealt with Angles claims that Reid voted to give illegal immigrants Social Security benefits   Barely True   and special tax breaks   False   Here  were checking the claim that Reid voted against declaring English our national language  twice During a big push for a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2006  Sen James Inhofe  R Okla  proposed an amendment   SAMDT4064   to declare English as the national language of the United States and to promote the patriotic integration of prospective US citizens The amendment would have required all official government functions  including steps toward citizenship  to be conducted in English It also sought to establish that there is no entitlement to receive federal documents or services in languages other than English  unless required by law Arguing for the amendment  Inhofe said providing multilingual assistance costs the government more than  1 billion per year Under the Inhofes proposal  immigrants seeking to become permanent legal residents would have had to prove they had learned English Reid made an impassioned speech from the Senate floor on May 18  2006  denouncing the bill as racist and divisive Heres a sampling of some of his comments to give you a flavor of Reids position     While the intent may not be there  I really believe this amendment is racist I think it is directed basically to people who speak Spanish    I think we should make sure that people who are 911 operators can immediately switch to somebody who can speak Spanish    Today  as I speak  the language of America is English We want people to integrate  to learn English  but they need tools to do this no matter what their native language This amendment takes some of those tools away  and we need all of those tools    The fastest growing component of adult education in America today is English as a second language This will slow that down This amendment impacts English speakers  reporting of crimes  reporting of diseases  involvement in commerce Next  is it going to impact upon the right to vote?    This amendment is divisive We should be here to unify our country  not divide it by ethnicity or language differences I rise in strong opposition to this amendment Everyone who speaks with an accent knows that they need to learn English as fast as they can Success in America means the ability to speak English That is the way it is now We dont need this amendment Speaking English is critical to the functioning of anyone in our country It is the language of our government  of our nation  and as I have indicated before  air traffic controllers and diplomacy This amendment  I believe  is unconstitutional It raises serious concerns that American citizens could lose some of their rights    This amendment directly conflicts with several provisions of federal law  I believe  that guarantee the right of non English speaking students to learn English in our public schools    This amendment conflicts with provisions of federal law that require language materials or assistance to be provided to voters in some areas of non English languages  where there is evidence of educational discrimination resulting in high illiteracy and low registration turnout    There has been substantial evidence of harassment  intimidation  even violence against language minority voters This provision makes a blatant violation of the 14th and 15th amendments and criminal provisions of the Voting Rights Act more likely to occur    By the very terms of this amendment  persons accused of crimes would be denied the ability  I believe  to receive information material in their native language to assist in their own defense This clearly violates the due process clause of the fifth amendment of our Constitution    I have talked about public health This amendment will stand in the way of efforts made to facilitate the transmission of vital information necessary for the receipt of health care and public safety  including informed consent by non English speaking patients    I hope we reject this amendment It is bad policy It is un American It turns back the clock on the substantial gains that language minority citizens have made I hope that there will be a resounding vote against this I have no problem going home today and telling the people of the State of Nevada  English is the language of America We are not going to change that with this amendment This is divisive  it is mean spirited I think it is the wrong way to go So tell us how you really feel about the amendment  Senator Needless to say  Reid voted against it  but with the help of 11 Democrats  the amendment passed 62 35 Interestingly  the Senate also passed a subsequent amendment   SAMDT4073   proposed by then Sen Ken Salazar  D Colo  to declare that English is the common and unifying language of the United States  and to preserve and enhance the role of the English language Reid voted for that amendment  which passed by a vote of 58 to 39 The immigration reform bill did not pass that year  however  and when a second stab at comprehensive immigration reform was undertaken in 2007  Inhofe again proposed an amendment   SAMDT1151   to declare English as the national language of the government of the United States  and for other purposes Reid again voted against it  though the measure passed 64 33 But that immigration reform bill never came to pass either To this day  no official language exists at the federal level The bottom line here is that Reid twice voted against amendments to declare English as the national language of the Government of the United States  even as he voted for an amendment to declare that English is the common and unifying language of the United States The ad says Reid twice voted against declaring English our national language Reid not only voted against the bills  he was quite vocal in his opposition,2,0,1137,real

Wheres the common ground? Krugman wrote Krugman  who sides with the Democrats over Republicans on budget issues  said the Democrats have a winning case to present to the public For what its worth  polls suggest that the publics priorities are nothing like those embodied in the Republican budget  Krugman said Large majorities support higher  not lower  taxes on the wealthy Large majorities   including a majority of Republicans   also oppose major changes to Medicare Of course  the poll that matters is the one on Election Day But thats all the more reason to make the 2012 election a clear choice between visions We decided to check Krugmans numbers on the polls after a reader asked us to look into it  Lets take the issues one at a time Large majorities support higher  not lower  taxes on the wealthy Different polls phrase the question differently  but the bottom line is the same We found three recent polls that back up Krugmans point In order to reduce the national debt  would you support or oppose raising taxes on Americans with incomes over 250 thousand dollars a year?

In economics  wealth is commonly measured in terms of net worth  and its defined as the value of assets minus liabilities For someone in the middle class  that could encompass the value of their 401 k  or other retirement accounts  bank savings and personal assets such as jewelry or cars  minus what they owe on a home mortgage  credit cards and a car note It does not include income    what people earn in wages For that reason  someone who earns a good salary but has little savings and owes a lot of money on their house would have a negative net worth In fact  because so many Americans invest in real estate to buy a home  middle class wealth has been one of the biggest casualties of the housing driven recession From 2007 to 2010  typical families lost 39 percent of their wealth  according to the Federal Reserves Survey of Consumer Finances   done every three years In 2007  the median family net worth was  126 400 In 2010  it was  77 300  according to the survey Where the Waltons fit in Six members of the Walton family appear on the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest Americans Christy Walton  widow of the late John Walton  leads the clan at No 6 with a net worth of  253 billion as of March 2012 She is also the richest woman in the world for the seventh year in a row  according to Forbes Here are the other five  No 9  Jim Walton   237 billion No 10  Alice Walton   233 billion No 11  S Robson Walton  oldest son of Sam Walton   231 billion No 103  Ann Walton Kroenke   39 billion No 139  Nancy Walton Laurie   34 billion Thats a grand total of  1027 billion for the whole family Sylvia Allegretto  a labor economist at the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at the University of California Berkeley  compared the Waltons cumulative net worth with that of the overall population  as cited in the Survey of Consumer Finances  She used the Waltons wealth from 2010  which was valued at  895 billion  Allegretto found that in 2007  the wealth held by the six Waltons was equal to that of the bottom 305 percent of families in the US In 2010  the Waltons share equaled the entire bottom 415 percent of families That 415 percent represents nearly 49 million families  notes Josh Bivens at the left leaning Economic Policy Institute While median family wealth fell by 388 percent  Bivens wrote  the wealth of the Walton family members rose from  733 billion in 2007 to  895 billion in 2010  or about 22 percent growth Other analysis At Forbes  source of the richest 400 list  Tim Worstall wrote a response to the Waltons wealth claim He did not dispute the accuracy of the statistic but offered some broader perspective Wealth is always more unequally distributed than income  Worstall wrote By the way  it isnt even true that all of those households with zero or negative wealth are what we would call poor  either Its entirely possible to have no net assets while having a good income  even a high income All you need to have is debts higher than your assets  something that will almost certainly be true of anyone with student debt and fresh out of college  for example He added  If youve no debts and have  10 in your pocket you have more wealth than 25 percent of Americans Bivens  for good measure  calculated the comparison of the Waltons vs all Americans after removing households with a negative net worth    those that drag down the overall average and make the Waltons advantage look greater He found that the Walmart heirs  895 billion is still equal to the combined net worth of the bottom 332 million families  about 282 percent of the total ,2,0,730,real

Nearly 36 million Americans The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  a division of the Department of Health and Human Services  estimated that total discounts added up to  21 billion  or an average of  604 per beneficiary It also said 3 576 640 people enjoyed those savings  For a state by state breakdown  check out the chart at the bottom of the fact sheet  The CMS numbers are based on 2011 Part D claims data received through Feb 29  2012  the agency said We didnt see any reason to doubt the figures  but CMS is a federal agency under Obama  and this is an Obama campaign ad So we ran it by Hoadley and Hargrave  who both said the 36 million figure checks out Hargrave pointed us to another CMS chart   which totalled the number of beneficiaries in the doughnut hole in 2011 at 3 758 024    including the territories    and about 36 million in the 50 states  See the first chart in the zip file ,1,0,611,real
7888,2013-06-13T14:39:54-04:00,2013,abcnewsgocom,Mark Udall,Currently  the intelligence community can collect business records on law abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism,While most Americans seem ready to support intelligence agencies casting a wide net against terrorists  they have some concerns about the scope of domestic surveillance  Congress began hearings on the surveillance of phone calls and Internet traffic that became public last week On June 9  2013  ABCs This Week with George Stephanopoulos aired footage of comments from Sen Mark Udall  D Colo In a floor speech roughly two years ago   Udall urged his colleagues to narrow the reach of the USA Patriot Act  one of the key legal tools that allow the United States to gather intelligence Udall had been briefed on the program that stored data on millions of phone calls made in the United States  but secrecy rules prohibited him from offering details Instead  he warned broadly that the intelligence community can collect business records on law abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism Udalls office affirmed that they still reflect the senators position So we wondered whether the law allows the intelligence community to legally collect business records on law abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism Udall cited Section 215 of the Patriot Act as the relevant part of the law This provision was reportedly the one used by the government to obtain a broad sweep of metadata    information on phone numbers  call durations and other information short of the actual conversations    from Verizon customers Section 215 allows the FBI to require the production of any tangible things  including books  records  papers  documents  and other items  for an investigation to protect against international terrorism However  the government faces some limits The FBI must demonstrate to a special court  the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court  that it has reasonable grounds to believe that the tangible things being sought are relevant to an investigation involving terrorism Approval must be renewed every three months The law also requires steps to limit access to information beyond the scope of the investigation After the  Guardian  published its article on the gathering of millions of phone records from Verizon customers  the director of national intelligence  James Clapper  addressed the business records provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Clapper said the program does not allow the government to listen in on anyones phone calls The information acquired does not include the content of any communications or the identity of any subscriber The only type of information acquired under the courts order is telephony metadata  such as telephone numbers dialed and length of calls  Clapper said in a written statement Gen Keith Alexander  the head of the National Security Agency  acknowledged in a Senate hearing on June 12 that the NSA has collected millions of records under section 215 In short  the program that obtained the data on Verizon customers was deemed legal by the FISA court  and it produced what the government considered business records    specifically  metadata Information on millions of Americans was accessed  almost all of whom had no connection to terrorism Udalls claim appears accurate Congress wrote the law and key lawmakers were kept apprised of the program   the FISA court approved it  apparently on multiple occasions Former Sen Bob Graham of Florida  an Intelligence Committee chairman until 2005  said the ongoing activity speaks to the soundness of its legal footing It is being done  Graham said Given the fact that it has not been successfully challenged in the courts  that would suggest that it is within the agencys authority to do so Steve Vladeck  professor of law at the American University Washington College of Law  concurred that the law seems to be on the governments side Section 215 of the Patriot Act only requires that the data berelevant to a national security terrorism investigation  not that the individual whose data is seized have such a connection  Vladeck said Still  well point out a few things First  just because the government is doing it and a court is approving it doesnt mean that the metadata collection program will be upheld as constitutional indefinitely The American Civil Liberties Union has already begun to challenge the program   for instance And the Electronic Privacy Information Center  a group focused on the intersection of technology and personal liberties  charged in a letter to Congress that the FISA court had overstepped its authority The group said the government had failed to provide reasonable grounds for the collection of millions of Verizon telephone records Second  theres a distinction between collecting data and sifting through it While the government has been storing phone call information in a giant database  it cannot legally access that information willy nilly Before it can drill down into actual phone calls  it has to meet a higher legal standard  The government must convince the court that it has a clear and reasonable suspicion that the calls are relevant to terrorist activity Supporters of the program including the White House and lawmakers cite the need to get specific permission for database queries as an essential protection of individual privacy,0,0,827,real

No John McCain We checked the claim on McCains votes here As for the charge that McCain was mentioned as a running mate with Democratic nominee John Kerry in 2004? Thats true There are many  many references in the media to the idea that McCain was possible for the No 2 spot on the Democratic ticket Here are just a few    In March 2004  reports about the offer prompted Good Morning America host Charles Gibson to ask McCain about it in an interview on the show McCain answered  John Kerry is a very close friend of mine Weve been friends for years Obviously  I would entertain it But theres  I see no scenario  no scenario  no scenario where I  I foresee no scenario where that would happen   After Kerry picked John Edwards as his running mate in July 2004  the Washington Post reported that Kerry initiated phone calls to McCain about a possible crossover ticket  but McCain made clear he was not interested   A February 2007 article in Vanity Fair magazine titled Prisoner of Conscience says  Kerry felt close enough to McCain at the time to make multiple and serious inquiries about McCains interest in running for vice president on a national unity ticket  and McCain basked in the courtship  even if he knew nothing could ever come of it    And  in an April 2007 interview with the Web site myDDcom  Direct Democracy for People Powered Politics   Kerry says McCains people approached him about being on the Democratic ticket Responding to suggestions that McCain had approached prominent Democrats about switching parties  Kerry says  It doesnt surprise me completely because his people similarly approached me to engage in a discussion about his potentially being on the ticket as vice president So his people were active   lets put it that way Were not saying McCain gave the idea much thought or even that he was offered the job  but its clear he was mentioned as a running mate with John Kerry We rule this statement True,2,0,425,real

States of America,During an Oct 4  2011  interview on MSNBC  host Ed Schultz and Sen Bernie Sanders  I Vt  discussed the Occupy Wall Street protests  which are targeting the financial services sector Sanders offered a statistic designed to demonstrate the power of American banks Sanders suggested that many of the protesters have not seen the president be as strong as he should be on Wall Street  saying they want the federal government to take tougher measures against financial services companies Ed  today  you have six financial institutions  the largest six  that have assets that are the equivalent of 60 percent of the GDP of the United States of America  Sanders said  GDP stands for gross domestic product  We wondered whether Sanders math was correct When we contacted Sanders office  a spokesman provided testimony to a congressional oversight panel by Simon Johnson  a professor of entrepreneurship at the MIT Sloan School of Management Our six largest bank holding companies currently have assets valued at just over 63 percent of GDP  Johnson testified  citing figures for the fourth quarter of 2010 This is up from around 55 percent of GDP before the crisis  eg  2006  and no more than 17 percent of GDP in 1995 We wanted to find the original statistics  and we located them in a chart posted by the National Information Center  the federal repository of data about banks and other institutions for which the Federal Reserve has a supervisory  regulatory or research interest The chart lists the 50 biggest bank holding companies as of June 30  2011 Here are the top six and their total assets  1 Bank of America Corp   2264 trillion 2 JP Morgan Chase   Co   2246 trillion 3 Citigroup Inc   1957 trillion 4 Wells Fargo   Co   1260 trillion 5 Goldman Sachs Group Inc   937 billion 6 Morgan Stanley   831 billion Together  the top six companies assets were  9495 trillion For the second part of the equation    gross domestic product    we turned to the US Commerce Departments Bureau of Economic Analysis Though the time spans dont line up perfectly  we decided to use the GDP figure for 2010  the most recent full year That figure is  14527 trillion Dividing these top banks assets by the national GDP produces a result of 65 percent    which is actually a slightly larger percentage than Sanders had indicated  but certainly in the ballpark To make sure we werent missing something  we contacted a few experts on financial services issues They offered a few caveats    The comparison is a bit of apples vs oranges The banks asset figures are an aggregation measured at a single point in time  whereas the GDP figure is an aggregation of goods and services measured over time This distinction is the equivalent to a comparison of your net worth with your personal income  said Lawrence White  an economist at New York Universitys Stern School of Business Economists generally dont find these sorts of comparisons very useful or interesting So the best that can be said is that these comparisons provide a rough sense of comparative magnitudes   The data are constantly moving Several of these banks  especially Bank of America  have lost significant value since the figures were published in June 2011  said Satya Thallam  director of the Financial Markets Working Group at George Mason Universitys Mercatus Center The denominator  GDP  is always changing  as well So  any estimate is true for a specific point in time  but possibly out of date not long after its made   Banks overseas holdings significantly complicate the comparison For starters  the comparison Sanders is making doesnt mean that these banks own 60 percent of the US wealth  because some of these banks assets are in overseas holdings However  Sanders appears to be on safe ground with his phrasing  since all he said was that the two dollar figures were equivalent Potentially more problematic for Sanders is that the assets to GDP ratio for the top six bank companies in the US are actually quite modest when compared to the biggest banks in other nations A 2010 study by JP Morgan listed the 25 biggest banks internationally in 2008  along with the percentages of their home countrys GDP The highest was UBS  with 376 percent of Switzerlands GDP And six other banks all had assets as large as their home countrys GDP    Credit Suisse Group of Switzerland  218 percent   Dexia of Belgium  180 percent   Fortis of the Netherlands  155 percent   Royal Bank of Scotland of the United Kingdom  131 percent   Barclays of the United Kingdom  112 percent  and BNP Paribas of France  101 percent  All of these dwarf the combined holdings of the top six banks in the US  in part because Americas GDP is so much larger than the GDP of these other nations The significance of this fact for Sanders assertion  however  is less clear This doesnt tell us what is aproper orappropriate number  Thallam said One might reply that other countries are much more concentrated  but that only means theyre worse    not that were in a good position Some scholars  he added  have said that even at current concentration levels  US banks should be broken up because they create a too big to

The issue emerged in the Oct 16  2012  debate at Hofstra University after a question from the audience about how the candidates intended to fix income inequality for women Obama touted signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act   then said  Now  there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace For example  their health care You know a major difference in this campaign is that Gov Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making I think thats a mistake In my health care bill  I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured Because this is not just a    a health issue  its an economic issue for women It makes a difference This is money out of that familys pocket Gov Romney not only opposed it  he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage Romney later responded  Id just note that I dont believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not And I dont believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care or not Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives And the presidents statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong Its worth noting that they were talking past each other Obama was referring to whether an employer should dictate whether employees insurance covers contraceptives Romney sidestepped the issue about insurance coverage and said he opposes a different concept   whether employers can tell someone whether they can have contraceptive care For this fact check  were asking whether Romney has suggested that employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage The Blunt amendment Obamas support for his claim centers on something called the Blunt amendment Early this year  congressional Republicans made a big push to roll back a provision by Health and Human Services under Obamas health care law that requires most employers to provide birth control coverage without any out of pocket costs  with a limited exception for certain religious institutions In the Senate  Sen Roy Blunt  R Mo  sponsored an amendment that would exempt employers from providing any service that went against their beliefs or moral convictions At the time  the issue put the Obama administration on the defensive and the president himself appeared at the White House briefing room to explain a work around for religious affiliated hospitals  universities and the like A few weeks later  with a vote on the Blunt amendment pending  Romney was asked where he stood He told a Boston radio interviewer Of course I support the Blunt amendment CNSnewscom  a conservative news service  put the question directly to the Romney campaign Will Mitt Romney  on day one  rescind this mandate in its entirety   as the Catholic Church has urged the current administration to do   so that individuals  employers and insurers who have amoral or religious objection to contraception or sterilization will not be forced to violate the tenets of their own faith or act against their consciences? Romney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams responded  Yes Gov Romney would rescind the mandate in its entirety In April  Romney reiterated his opposition to the rule at a meeting of the National Rifle Association He said  As president  I will abolish it So the Obama campaign argues if Romney supports an employers ability to decline to provide a service that goes against beliefs or moral convictions  that means he supports employers making the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage Romneys response We asked the Romney campaign to explain his objection to Obamas claim Heres a statement from spokeswoman Andrea Saul  Gov Romneys statement speaks for itself He does not believe that bureaucrats in Washington or employers should tell a woman whether she can use contraceptives  and no policy that he has proposed or supported would do so To the contrary  he has repeatedly made clear that he believes all women should have access to contraception and make such personal choices themselves The disagreement between the governor and President Obama on this issue is over whether the federal government should impose a nationwide insurance mandate for contraception The president wants bureaucrats to make that decision for all Americans  even where it violates their religious liberty Gov Romney does not The statement acknowledges that Romney opposes a nationwide mandate for contraception coverage In the absence of a federal mandate  that would sometimes leave the decision to employers whether to offer coverage for birth control  Before Obamacare  some 27 states already required such coverage   though were not sure how many had religious exceptions ,2,0,851,real

Meanwhile  people are suffering very badly I dont know how bad its going to get  and obviously the worse it gets  then  the more there is a role for goverment  McCain added But I cant come down yet and give you a specific solution  because I dont claim to be smart enough  but I do have some confidence in  Treasury Secretary Henry  Paulson and Im glad to see him more and more active in this issue Id love to give you a solution  but I dont know He also said he he relies on his advisers and other smart people to keep him up to speed on economic matters Lets stipulate that this interview does not showcase McCain at his best on issues of the economy and finance But Obamas statement that McCain said he didnt know of a solution to the mortgage crisis appears to be accurate given the full context of the interview,1,0,528,real

763,2008-10-09T00:00:00-04:00,2008,wwwilgagov,National Right to Life Committee,Barack Obama voted against born alive legislation in Illinois that was virtually identical to the federal law,The hot button issue of abortion is the subject of two recent political ads and a controversy centering on Barack Obamas votes in the Illinois legislature An independent advocacy group  BornAliveTruthorg  launched an attack ad on Obama  and the Obama campaign responded with an attack on John McCains abortion record For more on these dueling ads  read our story here As the controversy around the ads played out  the National Right to Life Committee disputed some of Obamas public comments about Illinois legislation concerning infants born alive  particularly a crucial bit of the legislation that became known as the neutrality clause The committee said the legislation had a neutrality clause  Obama said it didnt Heres the background  Opponents of abortion put forward legislation in 2001  2002 and 2003 intended to require doctors to provide immediate life saving care to any infant that survived an intended abortion The legislation  which included multiple bills  specified that an infant surviving a planned abortion is born alive and shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law The bills supporters said it gave added emphasis to laws already on the books  deterring the death of abortion survivors from neglect One of the bills strongest supporters was a nurse  Jill Stanek  who said she had witnessed infants left to die in dirty utility rooms Abortion rights proponents  on the other hand  said the legislation was a back door attempt to stop legal abortions Illinois already had a law on its books from 1975 that said if a doctor suspected an abortion was scheduled for a viable fetus   meaning able to survive outside of the mothers body   then the child must receive medical care if it survives the abortion The new laws didnt distinguish between viable and nonviable  meaning that an infant of any age that survived an abortion should receive care Well state at the outset here that Obama  along with other Democrats in the Illinois legislature  opposed the born alive laws every time they came up  and this is not disputed Why he opposed the legislation has become a controversial point during the presidential campaign  however The controversy hinges on how the two sides interpret the neutrality clause In 2002  two years before Obama was elected to the Senate  the US Congress took up its own version of born alive legislation  and passed it with a so called neutrality clause  which said the law would not change the legal status or legal rights of anyone prior to being born alive Abortion rights advocates said the clause was necessary to make sure the bill would not affect current abortion laws Obama has said as far back as 2004 that he would have supported the federal bill and that he would have supported the Illinois versions if they had had a similar neutrality clause The laws the full Senate voted on in 2001 and 2002 did not have such a clause  but 2003 is a different story The National Right to Life Committee says the 2003 bill did have a neutrality clause  and contends that Obama is misrepresenting the bill David Brody of CBN News  a Christian news group  asked Obama for his response to that in August 2008 I hate to say that people are lying  but heres a situation where folks are lying  Obama said I have said repeatedly that I would have been completely in  fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion Read his entire answer on the CBN Web site  We requested documentation from the Illinois State Archives about the 2003 bill and found that it did have a neutrality clause  as the National Right to Life said The clause was added at the committee level  and those records are not available online But we have posted the documents we received via fax from the State Archives here  The records are from the Health and Human Services Committee They show that on March 12  2003  the committee voted unanimously to add a neutrality clause to the born alive bill Then the committee voted down the bill on a 6 4 vote All the Democrats on the committee  including Obama  voted against the legislation  while the Republicans favored it But there is an important caveat to add here  We dont know what the discussion was at the 2003 committee because the proceedings werent recorded  but it seems likely that the federal neutrality clause was not considered sufficient at the state level  because the 2005 Illinois law that eventually passed included a more extensive neutrality clause than the federal legislation Lets compare the language of the various neutrality clauses The federal born alive legislation has passed and was the law at the time of the 2003 vote Heres what its neutrality clause states  Nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm  deny  expand  or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to beingborn alive as defined in this section The 2003 amendment that was before the Illinois Senate committee said this  Nothing in this Section shall be construed to affirm  deny  expand  or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive as defined in this Section Except for minor punctuation  the clauses are identical But heres the neutrality clause that was included in the successful Illinois born alive legislation of 2005 Note that it has two additional paragraphs Nothing in this Section shall be construed to affirm  deny  expand  or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive  as defined in this Section Nothing in this Section shall be construed to affect existing federal or State law regarding abortion Nothing in this Section shall be construed to alter generally accepted medical standards So the National Right to Life Committee is correct that the 2003 legislation did have a neutrality clause similar to the federal legislation But the federal neutrality clause wasnt sufficient to reassure the Illinois legislators seeking to protect abortion rights The law that passed had additional explicit protection for existing state law and generally accepted medical standards The bills sponsor said in 2008 that the extra language was included to satisfy the most zealous prochoice legislators But the National Right to Life Committee is correct that the 2003 version of the law did include a neutrality clause similar to the federal legislation  and Obama voted against it We rule its claim True,0,0,1131,real

Gravel told us hes on the ballot in North Carolina  May 6  and Oregon  May 20  Turns out he is confirmed for the North Carolina primary  but not Oregon Scott Moore  chief of communications for the Oregon secretary of state  told us they would have been happy to put Gravel on the ballot  but his campaign never filed the paperwork Hes also not on the ballot in Pennsylvania  April 22   Indiana  May 6  or Kentucky  May 20  Adding it all up  Gravel is on the ballot in just one of the 10 remaining contests We also determined that Gravel has zero delegates  virtually no fundraising and a campaign staff that amounts to the better part of about a half dozen people  according to deputy campaign manager Jon Kraus So  is Gravel still a candidate? He is Just not for the Democrats Gravel said he has pretty much had it with the Democrats and thinks they have cut their ties to him Yet hes intent on being on the November ballot one way or another In fact  he hopes to seal the deal in Denver But not at the Democratic convention At the Libertarian convention   May 22 26  2008 Right now hes actively pursuing the Libertarian nomination  Kraus said,4,0,445,real

The plan doesnt say    Lowering taxes and creating jobs  In a rare moment of specificity  the Republican plan says it would rewrite the tax code so that people making up to  100 000 would be taxed at a marginal rate of 10 percent and everyone above that would be taxed 25 percent Fair enough So how much would that cost? The plan doesnt say It offers a few other tax cutting ideas   tax deductions for businesses and an overall vow to keep the Bush tax cuts   but again there are no estimates about the impact on revenues    Controlling debt  The Republican plan says it will control debt by ending spending on bailouts for Wall Street For a savings of  hmm  doesnt say The plan also opposes runaway inflation and promotes keeping the cost of living low for families and entrepreneurs Sounds great! What that means for the federal budget  we couldnt tell you Now  we should note that the Republican document has some numbers in it But theyre numbers about Obamas budget  used to illustrate the partys complaints  under labels like Future Debt Burden and Expanding the Size of Government What the Republican plan lacks is the numbers that really matter  numbers that would show how much the Republicans propose to spend on various parts of government There are many pressing questions in the public debate that an alternative budget could answer For example  if were going want to cut wasteful spending  what programs should be cut? Also  what will cutting taxes do to deficit projections in years to come? But the Republican plan doesnt provide any answers The Republican House leaders said they will be releasing more data next week Perhaps that will include some numbers But Gibbs was right The first version of the Republican Road to Recovery is a budget without budget numbers,4,1,690,real

Obama said yes  it would   see their entire conversation on YouTube    but Obama defended his tax policy as being good for people who are struggling Its not that I want to punish your success I just want to make sure that everybody who is behind you  that theyve got a chance at success  too  Obama said During the debate  John McCain mentioned Joe the Plumber at least a dozen times as the kind of small business owner who would pay more taxes under Obamas plans Its not clear from the exchange just what Joe means when he says the business makes up to  280 000 a year Is he talking about total revenue? Profits? Thats an important point here and its one that Obama and Joe the Plumber never discussed Based on Obamas proposals and current tax policy  for Joes taxes to rise Joe would have to make  250 000 in net profit  after deducting all his expenses  his employees pay  his supplies  his truck  his fuel costs  and other legitimate business expenses Hed have to be an extremely successful plumber In response to McCains statements during the debate  Obama said only 2 percent of small businesses would be subject to the tax It seems likely that Obama is right  according to data and an analysis from the experts at the Tax Policy Center Obamas plan is to roll back the Bush tax cuts on the top two tax brackets In practice  this means that people with income above  200 000 for single people and  250 000 for couples would see taxes increase Now what does this mean for small businesses? Its not as easy as you might think to identify small businesses via the tax code But there are several typical ways that small business owners pay their taxes  usually by declaring business income on their individual tax returns Many people who declare business income are small businesses  though the group also includes professionals like lawyers  authors  or public speakers Looking at all the tax filers who report any business income at all  the Tax Policy Center confirms that about 2 percent will see their taxes increase under Obamas plan In an effort to focus more effectively on small business owners  the Tax Policy Center did an additional analysis where they looked at people who reported business income that accounted for at least 50 percent of their income This means people who derive a significant living off their business income In 2007  about 2 percent of those tax filers would have made enough money to see a tax increase under Obamas plans There is a small bit of uncertainty in the best data available  it includes some people who we would not think of as traditional small business owners But still  Obamas statement during the debate that 98 percent of small businesses make less than  250 000 matches the findings of a respected  non partisan group of tax analysts,4,0,610,real

When Im president  for every middle class American  the new tax rate on your interest  dividends  and capital gains will be absolutely zero I stood firm to roll back taxes as governor Ill roll back taxes as president In this case  then  Romney not only signed a written pledge but actively broadcast it to the electorate Its worth noting that the two pledges are not exactly the same One addressed the state context and one the federal context The Massachusetts text is a pledge to  all the people of this state  that I will oppose and vote against any and all efforts to increase taxes The Norquist pledge  to which Romney is still a signatory  requires the signer to oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and or businesses  and oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits  unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates Still  despite the differences in wording  we think the pledges are equivalent in their underlying requirements,1,0,936,real

News political reporter Chris Moody   who was there  tweeted it out  The economics Pauls comment referred to the 2013 government shutdown  which lasted just over two weeks from Oct 1 to Oct 16 During those two weeks  up to 850 000 workers were furloughed per day  national parks shut their doors  government funded scientific research halted  and various health and safety inspections    out of agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration     were put on hold So how does not spending money come at a cost? Sen Paul was making the point that the government never actually shut down during the so called shutdown  a spokesman told us Even though some government employees were furloughed  salaries were still paid for those who didnt work and government had to pay interest on late payments We found that this was true The government still functioned partially during the shutdown  and furloughed employees got back pay On top of doling out delayed payments  the government faced late payment penalties and other logistical costs associated with preparing or recuperating from two weeks of stalled activity They also lost revenue from national parks and museums But a more significant and documented blow was to the economy as a whole We found a solid consensus among economists that the shutdown was expensive to the US economy in terms of actual costs and lost productivity The most thorough report examining the shutdown came out of Nov 7  2013  from the Office of Management and Budget   which reports directly to the president  Pauls spokesman pointed us to this  New York Times  article about the White House report as evidence  Heres a few highlights   25 billion in compensation costs for furloughed workers  whose lack of pay for two weeks hampered consumer spending   120 000 fewer private sector jobs created in the first half of October   500 million lost in visitor spending because of closed National Parks    11 million in lost National Parks and Smithsonian Institution revenue  Interest accrued on billions of dollars of payments owed to third parties that the government was unable to pay during the shutdown  Resources spent on putting activities in standby or maintaining them in an idle mode  12 million Internal Revenue Service identity verification requests that couldnt be processed  causing a delay in private sector lending and other activities  Stalled approvals from the US Food and Drug Administration delayed moving products to market We also found estimates from financial analytics companies in the private sector All of these  about a dozen  showed a negative effect on the economy  though Most of the estimates predicted that the shutdown would not affect the economys growth path substantially  The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service compiled the reports in 2013  Mark Zandi   chief economist for Moodys Analytics  said the shutdown stunted fourth quarter GDP growth by 05 points  resulting in a  20 billion hit The shutdown disrupted federal spending  global trade and investments in housing and businesses Additionally  in the shutdowns aftermath  consumers held back spending and foreign confidence in the American economy waned Standard and Poors said the shutdown took  24 billion out of the economy and reduced yearly fourth quarter GDP growth by 06 percent  In December  the comic strip Doonesbury referenced this report  and we rated it Mostly True   Macroeconomic Advisers  in a report for the Peterson Foundation  estimated the shutdown cut 03 points off of fourth quarter growth  mainly by interrupting the flow of services produced by federal employees The Macroeconomic Advisers report said private sector effects were limited  especially because the furloughed workers received back pay Bloomberg News surveyed 71 economists and found the median GDP growth projection immediately after the shutdown was 04 points lower than a survey conducted a month earlier The counterargument In consulting experts and scouring shutdown coverage  we found no economic modeling or analysis that showed the economy staying neutral or experiencing positive growth as a result of the shutdown Some libertarians argue    such as economist Jeff Dorfman for Forbes     that just because the government didnt spend money for two weeks doesnt mean that the same amount of money didnt get spent elsewhere in the private sector  though he did not provide data or other proof that this was happening Dan Mitchell of the Cato Institute  a libertarian think tank  made a similar argument   but offered a caveat    that when government spending is suddenly reduced  the economy doesnt instantaneously recalibrate itself  so there can be economic bumps in the immediate aftermath    such as what was seen in the shutdown,1,1,932,real

3581,2011-04-13T13:39:57-04:00,2011,politifactcom,Tim Pawlenty,President Obama has stopped using the phrase war on terror ,In his book Courage to Stand  former Minnesota Gov Tim Pawlenty  a potential GOP presidential candidate  said President Barack Obama needs to do a more forceful job of reminding people about the threat of global terrorism And that needs to start with calling it by its real name  Pawlenty wrote Sadly  President Obama will not call this effort what it is  Pawlenty wrote He has stopped using the phrase war on terror His administration never makes pointed references    or any references    to the real problem  radical Islamic terrorism Apparently that isnt politically correct The fact is  radical Islamic terrorism exists Pointing that out doesnt condemn all Muslims But there is an element of Islam that is radical and that has terrorist intentions We need to call it what it is We need to confront it  and we need to defeat it This isnt the first time Obama has been accused of ducking the phrase war on terror or for not attaching the words Islamic or Muslim when talking about violent extremists Back in November 2009  we checked into a similar claim from Fox News Sean Hannity that Barack Obama wont even use the term war on terrorism  Back then  we did a word search of Obamas public statements and could not find that Obama has used the phrase war on terrorism as president  though he said it numerous times as a candidate Early in his presidency  Obama used the phrase war on terror  but only a couple of times And its true that Obama made a conscious and deliberate decision early in his presidency to avoid the phrase war on terror in favor of more precise language Obama explained his reasoning in several interviews During a Jan 27  2009  interview with Obama  Hisham Melhem of Arabic language television news station al Aribiya noted that Obama seemed to eschew President George W Bushs phrase war on terror and frame it in a different way  specifically against one group called al Qaida and their collaborators Said Obama  I think that youre making a very important point And that is that the language we use matters And what we need to understand is  is that there are extremist organizations    whether Muslim or any other faith in the past    that will use faith as a justification for violence We cannot paint with a broad brush a faith as a consequence of the violence that is done in that faiths name And so you will  I think  see our administration be very clear in distinguishing between organizations like al Qaida    that espouse violence  espouse terror and act on it    and people who may disagree with my administration and certain actions  or may have a particular viewpoint in terms of how their countries should develop We can have legitimate disagreements but still be respectful I cannot respect terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians  and we will hunt them down But to the broader Muslim world what we are going to be offering is a hand of friendship The issue was again raised in a Feb 3  2009  interview with CNNs Anderson Cooper  Cooper  Ive noticed you dont use the term war on terror I think I read an article that youve only used it once since inauguration Is that conscious? Is there something about that term you find objectionable or not useful? Obama  Well  you know  I think it is very important for us to recognize that we have a battle or a war against some terrorist organizations But that those organizations arent representative of a broader Arab community  Muslim community  You know  words matter in this situation because one of the ways were going to win this struggle is through the battle of hearts and minds Cooper  So thats not a term youre going to be using much in the future? Obama  You know  what I want to do is make sure that Im constantly talking about al Qaida and other affiliated organizations because we  I believe  can win over moderate Muslims to recognize that that kind of destruction and nihilism ultimately leads to a dead end  and that we should be working together to make sure that everybody has got a better life Based on those facts  we rated Hannitys claim True But when former Vice president Dick Cheney took the meme a step further and alleged that Obama will not admit were at war  we rated Cheneys claim Pants in Fire  Here  Pawlentys claim is closer to Hannitys So first we checked Obamas public statements since our previous fact check to see if he has stuck to this line and avoided the phrase war on terror or anything like radical Islamic terrorism And he has In May 2010  John Brennan  assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism  addressed the topic in some detail  The presidents strategy is absolutely clear about the threat we face  Brennan said in an address at the Center for Strategic and International Studies Our enemy is not terrorism because terrorism is but a tactic  Our enemy is not terror because terror is a state of mind  and as Americans we refuse to live in fear  Nor do we describe our enemy as jihadists or Islamists because jihad is a holy struggle  a legitimate tenant of Islam  meaning to purify oneself or ones community  and there is nothing holy or legitimate or Islamic about murdering innocent men  women and children Indeed  characterizing our adversaries this way would actually be counterproductive It would play into the false perception that they are religious leaders defending a holy cause  when in fact they are nothing more than murderers  including the murder of thousands upon thousands of Muslims Moreover  Brennan said  describing our enemy in religious terms would lend credence to the lie propagated by al Qaida and its affiliates to justify terrorism that the United States is somehow at war against Islam The reality  of course  is that we never have been and will never be at war with Islam After all  Islam  like so many faiths  is part of America Instead  the presidents strategy is clear and precise Our enemy is al Qaida and its terrorist affiliates For it was al Qaida who attacked us so viciously on 9 11 and whose desire to attack the United States  our allies  and our partners remains undiminished And it is its affiliates who have taken up al Qaidas call to arms against the United States in other parts of the world The presidents strategy is unequivocal with regard to our posture The United States of America is at war We are at war against al Qaida and its terrorist affiliates That is why the president is responsibly ending the war in Iraq  which had nothing to do with 9 11  and why he has refocused our efforts on Afghanistan  where al Qaida continues to plot from the tribal regions along the border with Pakistan and inside of Pakistan More recently  in remarks at the Adams Center  a nonprofit that runs community centers and mosques  on March 6  2011  Denis McDonough  deputy national security adviser to the president  spoke about the strategy of the Obama administrations words President Obama recognizes that through our words and deeds we can either play into al Qaidas narrative and messaging  or we can challenge it and thereby undermine it  McDonough said Were determined to undermine it In his book  Pawlenty claims Obama has stopped using the phrase war on terror and his administration never makes pointed references    or any references    to the real problem  radical Islamic terrorism We found several instances in which Vice President Joe Biden has talked about radical extremism or radical fundamentalism and the need to aggressively confront violent extremism and radical ideologies But he never attaches the words Islamic to those phrases And neither has Obama As Obama and members of his administration have repeatedly explained  this is a very conscious decision to be more precise about the enemy  al Qaida and other terrorist affiliates and not to feed into the al Qaida message that America is somehow at war with Islam You may agree or disagree with Obamas word choices  or with Pawlentys  but Pawlenty is correct about Obamas deliberate decision not to use the phrases war on terror or radical Islamic terrorism,3,0,1382,real

Keeping me  an African American  out of polling places Democratic Sen Ben Nelson of Nebraska  one of the Gang of 14  told McClatchy Newspapers in March 2008 that it was unfair to emphasize Obamas absence from the bipartisan group  because he wasnt pressed to join When we got to seven  Democrats  counting myself  there was some discussion of expanding it  Nelson said  but there was the thought it would be more unworkable In his book  The Audacity of Hope  Obama states   I declined to be a part of what would be called the Gang of 14  given the profiles of some of the judges involved  it was hard to see what judicial nominee might be so much worse as to constitute an extraordinary circumstance worthy of filibuster Still  I could not fault my colleagues for their efforts The Democrats involved had made a practical decision   without the deal  the nuclear option would have likely gone through In an interview with the St Petersburg Times on May 21  2008  Obama was less generous in his assessment of the deal The Republicans like to emphasize the Gang of 14 because frankly the Republicans got everything they wanted out of that  Obama said I dont think it was a particularly good compromise One can attach whatever significance one wants to McCains statement  but the bottom line is that its accurate,1,0,617,real

Is Elmo a lobbyist? So says Sen Jim DeMint  who is leading the charge to eliminate funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting DeMints Muppet rant was set off  in part  by a press conference on Feb 16  in which Rep Ed Markey  D Mass  stood alongside a life size version of Arthur from the animated PBS show of the same name  and blasted the Republican plan to eliminate CPB funding Rep Nita Lowey  D NY  said Republicans ought to be focused more on reviving the economy and less on silencing Cookie Monster and laying off Bert and Ernie DeMint  a Republican from South Carolina  responded with a blog post and an op ed in the Washington Times in which he argued that Sesame Street would do just fine without federal funding Shows like Sesame Street are thriving  multimillion dollar enterprises  DeMint wrote According to the 990 tax form all nonprofits are required to file  Sesame Workshop President and CEO Gary Knell received  956 513    nearly a million dollars    in compensation in 2008 And  from 2003 to 2006  Sesame Street made more than  211 million from toy and consumer product sales Big Bird will be just fine without his federal subsidies Thats a lot of Elmo dolls So we decided to check DeMints numbers  and to put his overall argument about Sesame Street solvency into some context We got the 2009 990 tax form submitted by the Sesame Workshop  the nonprofit group that produces the show  and DeMint is correct It shows Knells salary at  806 990  with an additional  149 523 worth of other compensation For the toy sales numbers  we have to go to the 2008 990 tax form In a section on other income  it reports toys and consumer products as bringing just over  211 million from 2003 through 2006  nearly  53 million a year  on average  Now for some of the bigger picture The 2009 tax form shows that Sesame Workshop brought in about  140 million in revenues in 2008  with government grants accounting for just over  14 million of that  roughly 10 percent  So would Sesame Street be just fine without that government money  as DeMint says  or would it silence Cookie Monster  as Lowey said They are probably both exaggerating Sesame Street is a lucrative enterprise  and Big Bird isnt likely to jump ship to Nickelodeon if federal funds are eliminated But some of the services Sesame Street provides might  according to a statement released by Knell  the Sesame president As a nonprofit organization which has a long history of building public and private partnerships  Sesame Workshop has benefited from the generous support of CPB  the Corporation for Public Broadcasting   which most recently provided critical grant support for literacy programs for 6 9 year olds  like The Electric Company  Knell said in a statement released Feb 15  2011 CPB has helped support our work with military families to provide social and emotional coping skills for children of parents serving in Iraq and Afghanistan who have left family behind during deployment It also has provided important funding for our work helping parents who have lost jobs or been displaced due to the economic recession to keep their families intact and positively motivated Additionally  CPB has been active in helping transition video content into digital assets to be used in schools and distributed through web based applications nationwide With federal funding an annual and often highly political battle  Sesame Workshop and many other companies that get support from the CPB have tried to become increasingly less reliant on government support According to a fact sheet provided by Sesame Workshop  revenues from sales of its products offset about two thirds of the research and production costs associated with the Workshops educational programs The remaining one third comes from a combination of philanthropic support  corporate sponsorship and government funding As a result of this financial revenue model  the fact sheet says  we are able to deliver each new season of Sesame Street to PBS with more than 93 percent of production costs covered by licensing activities or corporate sponsorships In 2010  Sesame Workshop had total operating revenues of  1364 million and total operating expenses of  1365 million Under different circumstances  Republicans might be cheering Sesame Street for making money the good old fashioned way through merchandise sales instead of relying as heavily on federal handouts  said Steve Behrens  editor of Current  a newspaper and website about public media in the United States Now  he said  that success is being used against it Its so successful  the argument goes  it doesnt need the governments help Sesame Street might be okay without federal funds  Behrens said  but other kids programs that are less successful selling dolls might not be  Indeed  were thinking that sales of Jim Lehrer plush toys may not cover the full cost of the NewsHour  Particularly hard hit by elimination of CPB funds would be some of the independent programming that gives public broadcasting its identity  Behrens said The independent productions are almost all paid by federal money or foundations  Behrens said Foundations only pay for things they have a direct interest in They want programs that reflect their interests and promoting their ideasThere are strings attached to every piece of money that comes in to public broadcasting Except for the federal piece Certain things would disappear  Behrens said  and the whole idea that it belongs to the public  there would be less reason to think that It would be nice if some of the money coming in to public broadcasting didnt have so many strings attached to it In an op ed piece  Jonathan C Abbott  president and CEO of WGBH  and Charles Kravetz  general manager of WBUR  argue the elimination of CPB funds would hit smaller  rural stations the hardest Each federal dollar provides critical seed money that public broadcasters leverage to raise more than six more dollars from local sources  they wrote As crucial as CPB funding is to stations in major metropolitan areas like ours  the situation is even more dire for smaller stations  where federal funding truly is the life blood Charles Chamberlain  political director for liberal group Democracy for America  said the point of public broadcasting is that the programs offered should not must not be subject to the whims of corporate sponsors and the ups and downs of merchandise sales The shows and programs on public TV are subject to the needs of the entire public The public funds these important programs as an alternative to the privately funded model used for programing on network and cable TV because profit shouldnt be the driving force behind every single form of broadcast media  especially educational programing So the point here is not if Sesame Street can survive without publicly funding The point is Sesame Street must stay independent of corporate sponsors or merchandise sales to retain its public educational mission and meet the full needs of the entire public  Chamberlain said Again  were fact checking Sen DeMints statement that Sesame Street raked in tens of millions of dollars from toy and consumer product sales over a recent four year period  a figure cited as backing for his larger argument that Big Bird will be just fine without his federal subsidies Federal grants make up less than 10 percent of Sesame Streets budget Whether Sesame Street would be just fine without that money is largely in the eye of the beholder It seems unlikely that cutting federal funds would spell the end of Sesame Street  though some argue it might cause the demise of some small  rural stations that carry Sesame Street Still  as its own tax filings show  Sesame Street makes a lot of its revenue from non government sources  much of it through the sale of toys and other consumer products Toy revenue is just a portion of Sesame Streets budget and federal funding for Sesame Street is just a portion of the overall issue of federal funding for public broadcasting But DeMints figures on Sesame Street toy revenues are right,2,0,1347,real

And I dont mind  Clinton said during a Feb 26  2008  Democratic debate in Cleveland  Ohio You know  Ill be happy to field them  but I do find it curious And if anybody saw Saturday Night Live   you know  maybe we should ask Barack if hes comfortable and needs another pillow A few boos could be heard before the debate continued Clinton is right She has received the first question in five of the six debates this year Heres a look at the opening question for each of those debates    Jan 5 in Manchester  NH  Moderator Charles Gibson of ABC News asks Sen Barack Obama if he stands by a foreign policy speech in which he said he would go into western Pakistan if  he  had actionable intelligence to go after  Osama bin Laden  whether or not the Pakistani government agreed   Jan 15 in Las Vegas  Moderator Brian Williams of NBC News asks Clinton how  on Rev Martin Luther King Jrs birthday  race became such a prominent issue in the campaign How did we get here? he asks   Jan 21 in Myrtle Beach  SC  CNN correspondent Joe Johns asks Clinton  How much money would your stimulus plan put in the pockets of the average South Carolinian?   Jan 31 in Los Angeles  first one on one debate   Doyle McManus  Washington bureau chief for the Los Angeles Times  asks Clinton what she thinks is the most important policy distinction between her and Obama   Feb 21 in Austin  Texas  Univision anchor Jorge Ramos starts things off in Spanish  The question for you  Senator Clinton  Would you be willing to sit down with Raul Castro  or whoever leads the Cuban dictatorship when you take office at least just once  to get a measure of the man?   Feb 26 in Cleveland  NBCs Williams questions Clinton about the change in tone between the Feb 21 debate and rhetoric on the campaign trail  You would agree the difference in tone over just those 48 hours was striking  he says Still  its funny that Clinton would complain about getting the first question all the time because it wasnt too long ago that there were so many Democratic contenders that many were complaining about not getting enough questions Besides  in a debate format  isnt it a good thing to go first? In terms of receiving the first question  I have not seen people make a big deal about that  said Gordon R Mitchell  University of Pittsburgh professor and director of the William Pitt Debating Union  one of the nations oldest debate organizations There are issues about who gets to speak first in terms of opening speeches and closing speeches  but in this format  where there were a series of questions  if there was an advantage or disadvantage to receiving the first question  it quickly was counteracted by the many follow up questions that evened things out Mitchell thinks Clinton got her message wrong My impression of what was happening here is Hillary was actually trying to say  Hey  I always get all of the hard questions  and it just came out as  Hey  how come Im always getting the first question?  he said Perhaps thats what she meant  but we can only evaluate what she said,6,0,628,real

When we asked the Cruz campaign for examples  they pointed us to a recent event at the University of Maine and Cruzs interaction with actress Ellen Page at the Iowa State Fair In fact  more than once is an understatement  Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips argued Admittedly  the press rarely writes about it  because it is common and generally a respectful exchange  Phillips said It happens all the time Campaign reporters we spoke with agreed with Cruzs statement  and we came across several examples of Cruz interacting politely with people with dissenting views or at least addressing their policy concerns Lets discuss Cruz made headlines in July 2015 when he debated anti war activists for 24 minutes at the Stop the Iran Deal Rally in Washington We want diplomacy  not war  a Code Pink protester yelled a few seconds into Cruzs speech You know its very interesting thing to see those who profess to believe in free speech who are afraid of speech  he said  before inviting the protester and his colleagues to come forward and discuss their opposing views A month later  Cruz famously sparred with Ellen Page over the intersection of religious freedom and gay rights Cruz disagreed with Page on most  if not all  points  but kept the exchange going for about six minutes Even beyond flashy rallies and famous actresses  Cruz does genuinely engage voters  not necessarily protesters  who disagree with him  reporters covering the Cruz campaign told us For example  Politico reported on Cruz discussing Obamacare with a voter in Hubbard  Iowa  on Jan 30 The voter pressed Cruz on his vow to repeal the health care law  and told Cruz that his brother in law finally gained health insurance under Obamacare but died because tumors were discovered too late What are you going to replace  Obamacare  with? the voter asked Well  sir  Im sorry for your familys loss  Im sorry for your wifes loss  Cruz said and launched into a critique of Obamacare My question is  what are you going to replace it what? the voter continued to ask Cruz responded that he would allow insurance companies to sell plans across state lines and expand health savings accounts A day later  an angry farmer in Iowa grilled Cruz on his position against the ethanol mandate  as many cameras and microphones lurked  Heres a snippet of their exchange  Voter   Why are trying to put salt on our injuries and wanting to take away our subsidies for biofuels? Cruz  Well sir  Im not Voter  Yes  you are  you made that statement Dont tell me youre not Youre gonna keep it for the big oil people in Texas Cruz  Sir  Im happy to have a conversation with you but not to yell Voter  Ill quit yelling Cruz  Okay  Im happy to have a conversation  but Ill treat you respectfully Voter  I dont understand it  Cruzs ethanol position  Cruz  Okay  Im happy to answer Cruz then explained his policy views to the voter for six minutes and answered additional questions One sided discussions When it comes to actual protesters  Cruzs engagement is sometimes a bit one sided and is geared toward riling up his supporters  said Patrick Svitek of the Texas Tribune  Cruz  doesnt create a real dialogue Its more for show than anything  he said He doesnt exactly talk with the protesters  but he does provide some kind of rebuttal He is different from a lot of candidates in that he at least addresses what theyre trying to bring up Take  for example  how he handled protesters at the University of Maine on March 4 Cruz didnt debate them  but did use their appearance to double down on his immigration policy You wrote a sign that says Theres no human being thats illegal Now thats true Every human being is Gods creation  a precious gift from God But if you really believe that no human being can break the law  you will discover the falsity of that if you resist the police officer right now When protesters interrupted him later  Cruz quipped  They hear theres a Mexican border and they start chantingBernie?Build bridges  not walls   you know that is a very interesting statement But Im curious  what do you say to all those people who lose their jobs  what do you say to all those people whose wages are going down  what do you say to single moms who cant afford to provide for their families? Sir  sir  I appreciate you exercising your First Amendment right  but the First Amendment does not give you the right to silence others Cruz reacted similarly  reaffirming his opposition to eminent domain when protesters chanted hands off our public lands at a February rally in Las Vegas Thank you very much  sir  for expressing your views One of the great things about the First Amendment is that it even allows Bernie Sanders supporters to come to our events  Cruz joked  And let me say sir  you have a First Amendment right to express your views  but at the same time  85 percent of the state of Nevada is owned by the federal government That will end when I become president of the United States Heckling hecklers Of course  Cruzs reaction isnt to talk issues every time hes interrupted Often  he brushes it off with jokes When a heckler yelled   Ted Cruz looks so weird at a Jan 31 Cruz rally in Des Moines  Iowa  Cruz responded with wisecracks  Apparently  the bars let out early tonight and Is that Donald Trump yelling in the back? A few weeks earlier  a man interrupted Cruzs Jan 12 Second Amendment rally in Hudson  NH Why is everyone so excited about guns? They kill people  the heckler said Sir  you are welcome to be a part of the crowd  but you are not a part of this group I understand that youre very confused  Cruz responded  chuckling  as the man was escorted off stage As Cruz began to transition into a stump speech about freedom  a second protester got up on stage  prompting Cruz to take a harsher tone  Oh  weve got another young man whos very confused Son  thank you   hey  hey  this is not your stage  Boy  its almost like the Bernie Sanders people are scared The Bernistas are out in force! A month later  two men    who appear to be the same guys at the gun rally and identified as a guerilla comedy duo by the Huffington Post   tried to perform an exorcism on Cruz in Raymond  NH  on Feb 8 Ted Cruz  look in the mirror and let the evil spirit leave  leave your power hungry  demonic soul  one called out  Theyre very nice young men  a very confused fellow Apparently  theyre Bernie Sanders campaign  Cruz laughed Look at yourself in the mirror  the heckler yelled back You know  the very odd things  usually lefties dont believe in God  he said as the two were escorted out of the event Cruz cracked a Bernie Sanders joke when protesters interrupted his rally in Houston  Texas I understand you seem confused about the First Amendment  he said   addressing the protesters You have a right to speak  but you dont have the right to disrupt others Im curious  does that coordinated effort suggest the lefties are getting scared?,9,1,1353,real

I doubt it The Navys good safety culture is certainly one reason for its success  said Thomas B Cochran  senior scientist in the nuclear program at the Natural Resources Defense Council But there are other reasons The Navys reactors are much smaller and more robust than reactors used commercially They are designed for combat and to take jolts from being in a submarine So the comparison isnt entirely fair  he said In short  while there is debate about the relevance of McCains statistic  McCain is right when he says there have been no reactor accidents aboard the US Navys nuclear powered vessels,1,0,571,real
5778,2012-04-23T16:47:08-04:00,2012,wwwwhitehousegov,Barack Obama,In the past three years  weve added enough new oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some,President Barack Obama kept up the drumbeat for his all of the above energy strategy with a speech in the White House Rose Garden Addressing criticism that he has stood in the way of domestic production  in the April 17  2012  speech Obama said the opposite is true There are politicians who say that if we just drilled more  then gas prices would come down right away What they dont say is that we have been drilling more Under my administration  America is producing more oil than at any time in the last eight years Weve opened up new areas for exploration Weve quadrupled the number of operating rigs to a record high Weve added enough new oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some  Obama said  with a nod to middle school science class Weve been hearing a lot about oil production recently and have checked several statements from Obama and Republicans on the matter Here  we decided to check something we havent heard before    that the United States has added enough oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth since Obama took office First  its important to note that its unusual for presidents to become involved in decisions about pipeline construction  which is largely driven by whether the oil and gas industry is willing to make the large investment  an expert told us Obama rejected an expedited plan pushed by Republicans to build the Keystone XL pipeline  but he has also emphasized the importance of pipeline construction He has said that domestic production exceeds current pipeline capacity and in March signed an executive order streamlining the permitting and construction process of a new crude oil pipeline to Gulf Coast refineries For this item  were not addressing whether Obama deserves credit for the pipeline because of the limited role presidents have But we can check whether that much pipeline has been added To back up Obamas claim  the White House pointed us to statistics from the US Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration   which regulates pipelines The DOT figures were last updated in April 2012 with mileage figures through 2010 So they do not include pipeline that was added last year or this year Heres a comparison of the mileage at the end of 2008  right before Obama took office  and the end of 2010  Crude oil 2008  50 963 miles 2010  54 728  3 765 Petroleum products 2008  61 599 2010  64 752   3 153 Natural gas transmission 2008  303 182 2010  304 691   1 509 Natural gas distribution 2008  2 074 513 2010  2 095 690   21 177 That adds up to 2 490 257 oil and gas pipeline miles in 2008  and 2 519 861 in 2010 So thats 29 604 additional miles of pipeline According to NASA   the equatorial circumference of the Earth is 24 8736 miles Obamas comparison is accurate  and given that the latest figures only cover through 2010  the real  current figure is likely higher We asked two experts if the year to year comparison of pipeline miles is a valid measure and if anything else should be considered Jay Hakes  former director of the Energy Information Administration under President Bill Clinton  said the data are reliable and as near as I can tell  the assertion is well documented and correct Tadeusz Patzek  chair of the Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin  pointed out that many miles of those pipelines are field project gathering lines of small diameter and small throughput    not large transmission lines many of us think of Hes right According to the DOT numbers  21 177 miles of the new pipeline are listed as natural gas distribution lines Still  such lines are a necessary piece of the whole system Said Patzek  Without the small stuff youre not going to increase the flow rate through the large Is 29 604 miles over three years a lot? For some perspective  we looked at the miles added during the last three years of George W Bushs presidency They tell a wholly different story  63 243 new miles of small natural gas distrbution lines    more than Obamas overall total But crude oil? Just 756 miles Petroleum products  808 fewer miles in 2005 than in 2007 Were not suggesting Obama has done better than Bush in this regard The comparison simply reinforces the point that oil and gas supply and demand  and the industrys response to it  results from decisions made far from the White House,2,0,755,real

Giuliani told CNNs Jake Tapper Nov 13  So  the president doesnt have to have a blind trust For some reason  when the law was written  the president was exempt Giuliani has the law pretty much right Trump  as president  has no legal obligation to detach himself from his businesses and financial interests The law at issue is Title 18 Section 208 of the US code It says federal executive branch employees cant participate in government matters in which they or their immediate family has a financial interest Because of this law  some federal employees put their investments in a blind trust This allows them to sidestep the regulation and participate in a matter that might otherwise pose a conflict of interest But the president and the vice president  despite being executive branch employees  are exempt According to the laws definitions   Title 18 Section 208 does not apply to them  nor does it apply to members of Congress or federal judges It appears that presidents have mostly escaped the normal web of ethics and conflict of interest laws  said Scott Amey  general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight  a nonpartisan government accountability watchdog Amey added that presidents are allowed to accept gifts in many cases  too Its been this way since at least 1974  when the Justice Department issued a letter saying Title 18 Section 208 did not apply to the president Congress expressly codified the exemptions in 1989 In the 1974 letter  the Justice Department said the legislative history of this conflict of interest provision indicated that it was never intended to apply to the president Additionally  the Justice Department said placing conflict of interest laws on the president could constrain him in a potentially unconstitutional manner  though it did not give specific examples As the head of the executive branch  the president may not be able to   and arguably under the Constitution it might not be possible to require the president to   recuse from government decisions  said Richard Briffault  a professor of legislation at Columbia Law School While Title 18 Section 208 is the primary conflict of interest provision  there are other relevant rules  including a couple that dont exempt the president Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will have to disclose their finances  which is required of all high level federal employees  Briffault said But the disclosures are not as detailed as federal tax returns  which Trump has not released Then theres the Constitutions Emoluments Clause  which bans US government employees from accepting presents or compensation from foreign governments  noted Kathleen Clark  an expert on legal ethics and a law professor at Washington University in St Louis The Trump Organization has numerous foreign ties  including several overseas real estate deals with possible foreign government connections In 2012   for example  Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended a ribbon cutting ceremony for Trump Towers Mall in Istanbul If any of Trumps business arrangements involve the receipt of payments from foreign governments  I believe that he  or his entities from which he receives money  would have to forgo those payments  or he would have to detach from those entities  Clark said But its not fully clear that presidents are bound by the Emoluments Clause  and no court has weighed into answer this question The way the clause is constructred    that it doesnt specify the president  unlike other provisions in the Constitution  for example   and the fact that President George Washington himself took gifts from the French government without asking Congress for permission  together make a good case that it doesnt apply to presidents  said Seth Barrett Tillman   a professor at Maynooth University in Ireland who has studied the clause,1,0,740,real

Romney said he would take it from other parts of the budget    by abolishing Obamacare and by changing Medicaid to a block grant and turning it over to the states President Barack Obama said Romneys plan for more defense spending is a bad idea  because it isnt necessary Romney wants to spend another  2 trillion on military spending that our military is not asking for  Obama said In this fact check  we examine the claim that Romney is promoting something the top brass dont want Romney has outlined out his national security policy on his website There  he warned that restoring the military will not be a cost free process  and said he will begin by reversing Obama era defense cuts  with the goal of setting core defense spending   meaning funds devoted to the fundamental military components of personnel  operations and maintenance  procurement  and research and development   at a floor of 4 percent of GDP Whats 4 percent worth? The Pentagons budget is expected to run in the range of 32 to 35 percent of GDP in the next fiscal year According to the Center for a New American Security   a group with ties to both Republican and Democratic administrations  even a gradual ramp up to 4 percent would increase defense spending by  21 trillion over the next ten years  as reported by CNN  The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget  a bipartisan group focused on deficit reduction  uses that number too  as do other budget think tanks Romney seems to accept it  so as far as the  2 trillion figure goes  it seems reasonably accurate In the past  when asked about increasing defense spending in tough economic times  the Romney campaign has emphasized that the 4 percent goal will take some time to achieve While the campaign website describes the goal as a floor  campaign spokesperson Andrea Saul called it a target in an email to a Boston Globe reporter The first priority  Saul wrote  is to reverse Obama era defense cuts In the same article  one Romney adviser  Mackenzie Eaglen with the conservative American Enterprise Institute  said  Thats not a hard number and anybody would be crazy to suggest it is It would have to be a very slow ramp up and they would be hard pressed to even achieve a 4 percent base budget by the end of the first term This suggests there is some flexibility on Romneys part  although the candidate himself has not expressed that What the Pentagon is asking for In the debate  Romney said  Our Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917 The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission Were now at under 285 In fact  the 313 ship plan reflects a 2005 strategic review In April  the Secretary of the Navy   Ray Mabus  presented a new program that sets a goal of 300 ships Mabuss remarks came at a moment when Romney had been vocal in his opposition to the new approach A lot of this criticism is based on either incomplete and or inaccurate or outdated information  or a failure to see beyond the short term or a willingness to protect the status quo in spite of the changing world and in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary  he said The presidents budget calls for  487 billion in defense savings between now and 2021 His defense secretary  Leon Panetta  and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  General Martin Dempsey  have both spoken up for the plan  as have the heads of all five branches of the military We are developing today the Joint Force the nation will need in 2020  Dempsey told the Senate budget committee We will be a military that is able to do more than one thing at a time to win any conflict  anywhere Panetta acknowledged that the budget comes with risks but he said the departments plan was based on looking first at the threats the nation might face The department would need to make a strategic shift regardless of the nations fiscal situation  Panetta told the budget committee  We are at that point in history Thats the reality of the world we live in Administration critics say the reality was just the reverse A report from the conservative Heritage Foundation said  the administration set a goal of slashing the defense budget  and then crafted a strategy justifying such draconian cuts The president is the commander in chief Panetta works for Obama and the military answers to him To the analysts at the Heritage Foundation  the chain of command says it all But in the past  when military commanders have disagreed with presidents  they have found ways to get their complaints to the public This is not to say that all commanders are pleased with the trade offs they face But Nora Bensahel  deputy director of studies at the Center for New American Security  said she believes the president put a great deal of time into discussions with the military  and by and large  the commanders support the plan Its hard to see daylight between the military and the White House on this  Bensahel said Broadly speaking  it is always possible that the service chiefs would disagree over funding of individual programs but that is within the overall budget limits,2,0,931,real

illegally distributing steroids to wrestlers,US Senate candidate Linda McMahons experience as co founder  along with her husband Vince  of World Wrestling Entertainment has proved to be a double edged sword on the campaign trail in Connecticut While McMahon often touts her experience running the pro wrestling empire to boost her real world business cred  it also has left her open to accusations that the WWE uses sexist story lines and that there is rampant steroid abuse by some wrestlers In the final week of the race    which pits Republican McMahon against Democrat Richard Blumenthal    the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has begun airing an attack ad that attempts to body slam McMahon for tipping off a ringside physician about a federal investigation into the illegal distribution of steroids to some of the WWEs wrestlers Read this  a female narrator begins  as a legal document scrolls in the background Its a memo Linda McMahon wrote Evidence in a federal trial against her company McMahon was caught tipping off a ringside physician who was later accused of hiding evidence It didnt work McMahons ringside doctor was convicted of illegally distributing steroids to her workers Thats Linda McMahon A bad CEO A worse senator The memo in question    marked CONFIDENTIAL INTEROFFICE MEMO    was sent on Dec 1  1989  by Linda McMahon to Pat Patterson  a fellow executive at Titan Sports  the parent company of what was then the World Wrestling Federation It became part of the public record as an exhibit in a steroids related case against Vince McMahon and Titan Sports in the early 1990s But the story actually goes back a little further  to an investigation into ringside doctor George T Zahorian for distributing steroids to some of the WWFs wrestlers As the 1989 memo from Linda McMahon explains  a government official let slip at a fundraising event that the State of Pennsylvania is probably going to launch an investigation into the use of all illegal drugs including steroids In addition  McMahon wrote  this fellow mentioned that he was aware of Dr Zahorian and his relationship with WWF Zahorian was actually assigned throughout the 1980s to attend WWF exhibitions in Pennsylvania by the Pennsylvania Athletic Commission But following deregulation in 1989  promoters like the WWF were required to hire their own licensed physicians to be present at events Zahorian was scheduled to be the doctor on hand at an upcoming event in Hershey  Pa  but Linda McMahons memo makes clear the WWF wanted to distance itself from him Although you and I discussed before about continuing to have Zahorian at our events as the doctor on call  I think that is now not a good idea  McMahon wrote in the memo Vince agreed  and would like for you to call Zahorian and tell him not to come to any more of our events and to also clue him in on any action that the Justice Department is thinking of taking Its that last part  telling Patterson to clue him in about a possible steroids investigation  that forms the basis for the claim in the campaign ad In 1991  Zahorian was charged with distributing steroids to a number of WWF wrestlers  none of whom were charged because  at the time  it was not a federal crime to use steroids  only to distribute them  He was convicted and sentenced to three years in federal prison But that wasnt the end of the matter In the wake of the Zahorian indictment  federal investigators opened a wide reaching steroids investigation into the WWF And in 1992  the government filed an indictment against Vince McMahon and Titan Sports  alleging they conspired to unlawfully provide WWF wrestling performers with steroids to enhance their size and musculature  and thereby to increase the ticket sales for WWF exhibitions and the profits to Titan and McMahon In its indictment  prosecutors alleged Titan officials learned of a federal investigation into Zahorians activities and warned him about it Linda McMahons memo was entered in the case as Exhibit  2 According to the indictment  shortly after the memo was sent  a Titan executive known to the Grand Jury had a telephone conversation with Zahorian and directed him to destroy any records of Zahorians contact with WWF or WWF wrestling personnel It was later learned from one of Zahorians attorneys that after Zahorian got the phone call warning him about the investigation  he shipped files on wrestlers to his attorneys office  so they were not part of the evidence seized when investigators raided his office  But according to longtime WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt  the files were never destroyed and were later made available to prosecutors Dr Zahorian didnt destroy anything  McDevitt said It was all given to the government In any event  the governments case against Titan and Vince McMahon failed miserably Several counts were tossed before the case even went to the jury    including two counts alleging that Vince McMahon and the company distributed steroids to wrestlers such as Terry Bollea  aka Hulk Hogan   because the judge said prosecutors failed to establish that the alleged conspiracy occurred in the jurisdiction of the New York court where the case was filed And on the one remaining count  that they had distributed mislabeled anabolic steroids  both Vince McMahon and the company were acquitted In other words  none of the charges ever stuck In an extensive story about the issue in Connecticuts  The Day   reporter Ted Mann asked McMahon about the memo I dont pretend to remember to go back  to revisit all the aspects of that case  McMahon told The Day It has been tried  acquitted and done with  and WWE has evolved its total health and wellness policy over the years  and Im sure will continue to evolve According to the story  When asked if her decision to notify Zahorian had led him to destroy records that might have more thoroughly documented his sale of steroids to WWF wrestlers   as prosecutors in 1994 alleged   McMahons reply was curt I cant speak to any of that  she said I have no idea WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt said he believes the DSCC ad is misleading  because it suggests by innuendo that Linda McMahon sought to obstruct the governments investigation There were never any charges against Linda McMahon of any kind  McDevitt said There was never any charge of obstruction of justice against anybody An indictment is nothing more than an allegation  McDevitt said  and the case ended without a conviction against anyone on anything You can only gain an acquittal in this country  McDevitt said Thats all you can do Everyone agrees Linda McMahon was never charged with or convicted of anything  including obstruction of justice But the ad from the DSCC doesnt say she was The ad accuses McMahon of tipping off a ringside physician about a federal investigation into distributing steroids to their wrestlers How else could one interpret Linda McMahons direction in the 1989 memo to also clue him  Zahorian  in on any action that the Justice Department is thinking of taking Its also true that a government indictment later alleged that  after getting a call from a Titan employee tipping him off to the investigation  Zahorian tried to hide evidence at his attorneys office But whether Zahhorian tried to hide evidence may or may not be true Zahorian sent files to his attorney  but they were not destroyed  and according to WWEs attorney  they were later made available to investigators Nothing in Linda McMahons memo suggests she directed the employee to tell Zahorian to hide or destroy evidence But again  the ad doesnt say she did The ad merely says she tipped off the ringside physician about an investigation She did  according to her own memo And Zahorian was later convicted of distributing steroids to some of her WWF wrestlers,0,0,1293,real

A path to a national gun registry The government requires background checks for gun sales by licensed firearms dealers   but not for sales between folks who arent in the business of selling guns Manchin and Toomeys amendment expanded the background check requirement to sales at gun shows and those advertised in publications and on the Web But it didnt go as far as the original bill   which required background checks for all gun transfers with limited exceptions  That compromise wasnt enough to attract the 60 vote supermajority required to pass the amendment It failed on a 54 to 46 vote Opponents had  indeed  raised the specter of a national gun registry If your private gun transaction is covered by Toomey Schumer Manchin  and virtually all will be   you can assume you will be part of a national gun registry  wrote Michael Hammond of lobbying group Gun Owners of America  The existing background checks require filling out ATF Form 4473  That personal information is then run through the FBIs National Instant Criminal Background Check System The government is supposed to destroy personally identifying information  but gun dealers are required to store the forms The government is then allowed to inspect them in the course of criminal investigations or to ensure gun dealers keep the records theyre supposed to keep So what did the Manchin Toomey amendment say about a registry? First  it made reference to federal law that already bans creation of a federal registry Since the mid 1980s  its been against federal law for information from background checks to be recorded at or transferred to a facility owned  managed  or controlled by the United States or any State or any political subdivision thereof  nor that any system of registration of firearms  firearms owners  or firearms transactions or dispositions be established Thats why  if youre cleared to purchase a gun  the FBI is required to destroy all identifying information about you before the next business day The Manchin Toomey amendment doubled down on this ban  declaring  Congress supports and reaffirms the existing prohibition on a national firearms registry It also declared that nothing in the legislation should be construed to allow the establishment  directly or indirectly  of a federal firearms registry Later  it added these provisions    The Attorney General shall be prohibited from seizing any records or other documents in the course of an inspection or examination authorized by this paragraph other than those records or documents constituting material evidence of a violation of law   The Attorney General may not consolidate or centralize the records of the  acquisition or disposition of firearms  or any portion thereof   Any person who knowingly violates  the prohibition against consolidating or centralizing records  shall be fined under this title  imprisoned not more than 15 years  or both So  the amendment prohibited the centralizing of federal records   and added the threat of prison But those protections didnt reassure gun rights proponents The National Rifle Association argues that gun control supporters believe expanding background checks is a precursor to gun confiscation  An Arizona gun group spokesman told us the federal government would illegally collect background check information submitted to the FBI Sarah Palin  arguing against the Toomey Manchin amendment  said it  creates a path to a national gun registry  since dealers store background check forms and the bill didnt explicitly ban copying them  storing them in various locations  rather than centrally   or keeping a list of them She didnt mention that existing federal law   referenced by the bill   already prohibits any system of registration of firearms  firearms owners  or firearms transactions or dispositions,2,0,707,real

Well  I do think all issues are on the table  Gibbs replied Lets  though  just discuss the   I assume youre talking about the charitable contribution   I mean  a middle class family donates a dollar to charity  they get 15 cents off their income tax Bill Gates donates a dollar to charity  he takes 35 cents off his income tax The proposal that the White House has would simply reduce those levels to the same levels that we saw during the Reagan administration Budget director Peter Orszag made the same argument in this blog post  Lets walk through how charitable deductions impact taxes If you donate  1 to charity  you can list that as a deduction  meaning you can subtract  1 from your income before calculating your taxes High earners like Bill Gates pay a tax rate of 35 percent on the portion of their income that is over about  350 000 So if they subtract  1 from their taxable income  their tax burden drops by 35 percent of  1  which is 35 cents By contrast  couples with taxable income between  16 700 and  67 900 pay a top tax rate of 15 percent If they make that same  1 contribution  and subtract the  1 from their income  their tax burden falls by just 15 percent of  1  or 15 cents Gibbs point rests on the contention that couples making between  16 700 and  67 900 are middle class  which we believe is fair   the median household income in the US is  50 233  So Gibbs was right  except that he understated the case Heres how  First  you cant take any deduction for a charitable contribution unless you itemize your taxes Folks in the 15 percent tax bracket are unlikely to do so  while rich folks are very likely to Only 35 percent of all taxpayers itemized their taxes in 2004  but 87 percent of taxpayers in the top 10 percent were itemizers  according to the Urban Institute  Were not going to penalize Gibbs for understating his case  because his numbers hold true when comparing two taxpayers who itemize  and he confined his comment to the income tax Its worth noting that the rich only enjoy bigger deductions because they pay more taxes   a top tax rate of 35 percent instead of 15 percent  and an estate tax on top of that But its also true that a charitable contribution of  say   1 000 will take a much bigger bite out of a middle class persons income than a high earners Thats all academic though The bottom line is that Gibbs number are accurate,1,0,579,real

For this check  were looking at Clintons claim that Ryan attacked the president for the same amount of Medicare savings that  Ryan  had in his own budget We recently checked a similar claim from Obama campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter that Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget Were applying what we learned to Clintons remark  700 billion in Medicare cuts? There are cuts and then there are CUTS Neither Obama nor his health care law literally cut a dollar from the Medicare programs budget Rather  the health care law instituted a number of changes to reduce the growth of Medicare costs At the time the law was passed  those reductions amounted to  500 billion over the next 10 years Times passage has only boosted that number What kind of spending reductions are we talking about? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals  not beneficiaries The law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage  a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers Medicare Advantage was started under President George W Bush  and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers Hospitals  too  will be paid less if they have too many re admissions  or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care Still  the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future The health care law tries to limit that growth  making it less than it would have been without the law  but not reducing its overall budget So claims that Obama would cut Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate In the past  weve rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False  depending on the wording and context Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year  the cost saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger Also  it takes a few years for the health care laws savings mechanisms to kick in In fact  the effects of time are the main reason the  500 billion number has turned into  700 billion The Congressional Budget Office  the nonpartisan agency with expert staff that generates projections about how laws affect the federal budget and economy  determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by  507 billion between 2012 and 2021 In a more recent estimate released this year  the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by  716 billion Does the Ryan budget include the same savings as the health care law? Now onto our second question  Does Ryans budget include those same reductions in Medicare spending? The short answer is yes Heres what Ryan said in an interview with George Stephanopolous of ABC News in June  before his selection as Republican nominee Mitt Romneys running mate  Stephanopoulos  You know  several independent fact checkers have taken a look at that claim  the  500 billion in Medicare cuts  and said that its misleading And in fact  by that accounting  your budget  your own budget  which Gov Romney has endorsed  would also have  500 billion in Medicare cuts Ryan  Well  our budget keeps that money for Medicare to extend its solvency What Obamacare does is it takes that money from Medicare to spend on Obamacare    Read the full exchange   So Ryan confirmed his budget includes the Medicare savings The Romney campaign got questions on this point the day after Cutters remarks that Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget  and issued a statement saying that Romney intended to fully repeal the federal law  including the savings for Medicare Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have always been fully committed to repealing Obamacare  ending President Obamas  716 billion raid on Medicare  and tackling the serious fiscal challenges our country faces  said Lanhee Chen  Romneys policy director  in a statement reported by NBC News  A Romney Ryan administration will restore the funding to Medicare  ensure that no changes are made to the program for those 55 or older  and implement the reforms that they have proposed to strengthen it for future generations Cutter  though  was talking about the Ryan budget  as was Clinton We should point out that the Ryan budget is a congressional resolution that doesnt have the force of law And its plan for Medicare hasnt been turned into legislation that could be analyzed in detail by the CBO Still  Ryan himself said his plan did include the same reductions in future spending that were part of the federal health care law He explained a few days after Cutters remarks that it was only because Obamas reduction was already in the baseline  the Wall Street Journal reported  We would never have done it in the first place The article points out  however  that the budget assumed reversal of other Obama spending decisions So it was a choice to leave the reductions in place  likely because both sides agree on one point  Medicare spending is growing too rapidly  and it needs to reined in,4,1,1117,real

The Pentagons budget is expected to run in the range of 32 to 35 percent of GDP in the next fiscal year According to the Center for a New American Security   a group with ties to both Republican and Democratic administrations  even a gradual ramp up to 4 percent would increase defense spending by  21 trillion over the next ten years  as reported by CNN  The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget  a bipartisan group focused on deficit reduction  uses that number too  as do other budget think tanks Romney seems to accept it  so as far as the  2 trillion figure goes  it seems reasonably accurate Does Romney mean it The Romney campaign has an interesting response to questions about proposing this increase at a time when the government has a hard time paying its bills The staff emphasize that it might take some time to get to the 4 percent mark While the campaign website describes the goal as a floor  campaign spokesperson Andrea Saul called it a target in an email to a  Boston Globe  reporter The first priority  Saul wrote  is to reverse Obama era defense cuts In the same article  one Romney adviser  Mackenzie Eaglen with the conservative American Enterprise Institute  said  Thats not a hard number and anybody would be crazy to suggest it is It would have to be a very slow ramp up and they would be hard pressed to even achieve a 4 percent base budget by the end of the first term This suggests there is some flexibility on Romneys part  although the candidate himself has not expressed that What the Pentagon is asking for The presidents budget calls for  487 billion in defense savings between now and 2021 Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  General Martin Dempsey  have both spoken up for the plan  as have the heads of all five branches of the military We are developing today the Joint Force the Nation will need in 2020  Dempsey told the Senate budget committee We will be a military that is able to do more than one thing at a time to win any conflict  anywhere Panetta acknowledged that the budget comes with risks but he said the departments plan was based on looking first at the threats the nation might face The department would need to make a strategic shift regardless of the nations fiscal situation  Panetta told the budget c ommittee We are at that point in history Thats the reality of the world we live in Administration critics say the reality was just the reverse A report from the conservative Heritage Foundation said the administration set a goal of slashing the defense budget  and then crafted a strategy justifying such draconian cuts The president is the commander in chief Panetta works for Obama and the military answers to him To the analysts at the Heritage Foundation  the chain of command says it all But in the past  when military commanders have disagreed with presidents  they have found ways to get their complaints to the public Nora Bensahel  deputy director of studies at the Center for New American Security  said she believes the president put a great deal of time into discussions with the military and by and large  the commanders support the plan Its hard to see daylight between the military and the White House on this  Bensahel said Broadly speaking  it is always possible that the service chiefs would disagree over funding of individual programs but that is within the overall budget limits,1,0,884,real
4926,2011-12-12T11:40:26-05:00,2011,wwwnytimescom,David Brooks,Newt Gingrich has suggested building a mirror system in space could improve the Earths habitability,In a Dec 9  2011  column titled  The Gingrich Tragedy  New York Times columnist David Brooks expressed ambivalence about the new front runner in the Republican presidential race  former House Speaker Newt Gingrich  R Ga Brooks said that ideologically  Gingrich comes closest to my worldview But Brooks added that he was repelled by Gingrichs bombastic style and revolutionary temperament   intensity  energy  disorganization and a tendency to see everything as a cataclysmic clash requiring a radical response In the column  Brooks cites negatively what he considered half baked ideas by Gingrich For example  he has called fora massive new program to build a permanent lunar colony to exploit the moons resources He has suggested thata mirror system in space could provide the light equivalent of many full moons so that there would be no need for nighttime lighting of the highways The space mirror system seemed so outlandish that we felt compelled to check whether Gingrich really suggested it We e mailed Brooks to ask where he found this quote  but we didnt hear back We did  however  locate a similar quote in an article by Andrew Ferguson published in the New York Times magazine on June 29  2011 Ferguson read 21 books by Gingrich    a famously prolific author    in an attempt to answer his articles titular question  What Does Newt Gingrich Know? Heres a portion of what Ferguson wrote  Gingrichs first book   Window of Opportunity  A Blueprint for the Future   came out in 1984 and contained the seeds of much of what was to follow Beneath its cover image   a flag draped eagle inexplicably threatening the space shuttle  the backbencher Gingrich was identified as chairman of the congressional Space Caucus  a position that inspired a series ofspace cadet jokes that took years to die Window of Opportunity was co written by Gingrichs second wife  Marianne  and a science fiction writer called David Drake   In Window of Opportunity  Gingrich introduced himself as a futurist  a role he has played off and on throughout his career There are problems inherent in futurism  most of them involving the future  which the futurist is obliged to predict  its his job  and which seldom cooperates as he would hope Gingrich has called some and missed some In 1984  he saw more clearly than most that computers would touch every aspect of commercial and private life  but nobody any longer wants to builda large array of mirrors  that  could affect the earths climate  warming it up so farmers could extend the growing season Because the quotes from Brooks and Ferguson are slightly different  we wanted to look directly at the book ourselves before making our judgment In the book  Gingrich proposes  among many other ideas  five simple steps to a bold future in space  most unusually a lottery in which randomly selected taxpayers would win a spot on a space shuttle flight But the floating mirror idea isnt on this list Instead  its included in Gingrichs recap of a June 1979  NASA sponsored new concepts symposium in Woods Hole  Mass  where 30 experts brainstormed a range of pioneering options for NASA worthy of Lewis and Clark Heres how Gingrich summarized the idea  The climate group at the Woods Hole conference suggested that a large array of mirrors could affect the earths climate by increasing the amount of sunlight received by particular areas  citing recent feasibility studies exploring the possibilities of preventing frosts in Florida or enabling farmers in high altitudes to plant their wheat earlier A mirror system in space could provide the light equivalent of many full moons so that there would be no need for nighttime lighting of the highways Ambient light covering entire areas could reduce the current danger of criminals lurking in the darkness Mirrors could be arranged to light given metropolitan areas only during particular periods  so there would be darkness late at night for sleeping Brooks portrayal glosses over the fact that Gingrich was primarily reciting proposals made by participants at a NASA sponsored forum Still  Gingrich cited them approvingly Still  we didnt want to stop with a look at whether Brooks framed the issue fairly We also wanted to know whether this was ever a mainstream idea    and whether its technologically feasible One thing thats clear is that it was not a new idea by the time it was raised at Woods Hole At least two space pioneers promoted the concept in the 1920s  a full four decades before man landed on the moon Hermann Oberth  1894 1989   a scientific author based in Germany  published several books in the 1920s that anticipated the first rockets and satellites   the landing on the moon  interplanetary probes  international manned space stations  and reusable space ferries  according to the museum that celebrates his life near Nuremberg  Germany  Among the ideas discussed in his books was extraterrestrial utilization of the suns energy with huge space mirrors that beam the collected sun energy down to earth These ideas were popularized in a book by another space pioneer  an Austro Hungarian named Hermann Noordung  1892 1929  in a 1928 book   The Problem of Space Travel  The Rocket Motor  So the idea is an old one But despite several decades worth of advances in space technology by the time Gingrich published his book  space experts and scientists told us that the idea never got much beyond the science fiction stage Yuri Pavlovich Semenov    until 2005 the chief designer for Energia  the developer of Russian manned spacecraft    was quite a proponent of the idea  said Marcia Smith of spacepolicyonlinecom During the Soviet era  Semenov and his allies thought such a technology could light up the northern latitudes of the USSR However  it was considered impractical by the mainstream space crowd  not just technically but in terms of the potential environmental effects  Smith said John Logsdon  the founder and retired director of the Space Policy Institute at the George Washington University Elliott School of International Affairs  said that similar ideas have been suggested over the years byout of the box thinkers  but they never entered the mainstream Others have suggested using mirrors to reflect the suns rays away from the earth  as a way to attack global warming  said Edward Ellegood  a space policy analyst at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University But where Gingrichs idea is concerned  Ellegood said  Its probably not even remotely cost effective Heres another problem  Micro meteorite bombardment would destroy these mirrors over a few year time period  said Gregory Bothun  a University of Oregon physicist The experts we spoke to for this story agreed that even if the idea proposed by Gingrich in 1984 was economically and technically feasible  it would entail too many downsides to be desirable Imagine a world where it never got dark! What would this do to plants  animals  my sleep  and the souls of poets and lovers everywhere? said Scott Denning  an atmospheric science professor at Colorado State University  in an e mail Imagine having a really annoying neighbor who beams sodium vapor lamps into your bedroom windows Now imagine everyone in the world having such a neighbor Raymond S Bradley  a geoscientist at the University of Massachusetts  put it simply  This is not a mainstream idea It is one of the dumbest ideas I have heard of,2,1,1208,real

You know what  Greta  I dont have the answers to everything Im not running for political office I dont have the answers to everything  you know  in the world out there But I think that there should be rights for people  you know  especially in California I think that people that are homosexual should have some rights  you know  hospital rights  and things like that Granted  her answer may not be as nuanced as Obamas As she said  shes not running for public office Still  her fuller position also sounds an awful lot like Obamas But what Prejean said after the pageant isnt the issue Prejean and The Donald said the position she took the night of the pageant is consistent with President Obamas position,1,0,668,real

If the debt to GDP level were to go to 82 percent  Heritages Riedl said  Its a simple fact that interest rates would go through the roof Moreover  he said  it would be harder for companies to borrow money  harder for people to get mortgages It would decrease productivity and overall economic growth Its just not a sustainable ratio  Riedl said Jonathan DeWald  a spokesman for the Concord Coalition  a nonpartisan  organization that specializes in analysis of budget deficits  also cautioned that as interest rates increase in coming years  interest payments on the growing national debt will continue to eat up more and more of the overall budget Obama has warned not to place too much stock in the out years of budget  projections because none of us know exactly whats going to happen six or eight  or 10 years from now And Obama has said that making investments today in education  health care and energy will pay off down the road with a stronger economy  which presumably would create a better debt to GDP ratio Gregg is on solid ground  relying on projections from the CBO  a highly respected  nonpartisan arm of Congress  about the long term debt to GDP ratios,1,0,731,real
11960,2016-02-26T15:09:23-05:00,2016,politicaladarchiveorg,Hillary Clinton,African Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do,Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have been trying to court black voters ahead of the South Carolina Democratic primary by talking about the need to address systemic racism In a 30 second commercial   Clinton says  Something is just fundamentally broken when African Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do We wanted to see if theres evidence that being black influences whether someone will be arrested and  once convicted  ordered to do more time HELP US RAISE  15 000 TO HIRE AN IMMIGRATION FACT CHECKER The question plays out against a stark statistic   although African Americans make up 13 percent of the general population   they account for 36 percent of the inmate population  according to the latest data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics Risk of arrest A heap of evidence shows African Americans are arrested at higher rates The Clinton campaign pointed out a Washington Post blog post  referring to a Brookings Institution piece   that said blacks are 36 times more likely to be arrested for selling drugs than whites even though whites are 45 percent more likely to sell drugs than blacks But the data is from 1980  part of a paper that talks about drug dealing and legitimate self employment The campaign also had fresher data in mind  however  including a USA Today analysis of arrest rates around the country in the wake of the racial unrest in Ferguson  Mo In at least 1 581 of 3 538 police departments  the paper found  blacks were even more likely to be arrested than in Ferguson Only 173 departments arrested black people at a rate equal to or lower than other racial groups  the paper reported The Bureau of Justice Statistics periodically surveys the public to study police citizen interactions Its most recent report in 2008 found that white  black and Hispanic drivers were stopped at similar rates by police However  black drivers were about three times as likely as white drivers to be searched during a traffic stop  When a search occurred  evidence was found in only 84 percent of the cases  but the report doesnt break that down by race  The Sentencing Project   an advocacy group  has looked at that breakdown using 2013 profiling data posted in 2014 by Missouris attorney generals office It found that when a white driver was stopped in Ferguson  there was a 7 percent chance the car would be searched and a 34 percent chance that something would be found But when a black driver was stopped  the search rate was significantly higher   12 percent   and the odds of actually finding contraband were significantly lower  22 percent  Not only that  blacks were twice as likely as whites to be arrested during a traffic stop In a spot check  we found similar patterns in Jefferson City  Its not just traffic stops According to a National Research Council report  drug arrest rates have long been higher for blacks  even though data show that blacks are generally no more likely to use drugs than whites and theres little evidence that they sell drugs more often than whites What surveys have shown is that the levels of self reported drug sales are about the same for blacks and whites  especially under age 20  said Michael Tonry  professor of law at the University of Minnesota But the big differences are that whites are more likely to sell to people they know  and they much more often sell behind closed doors Blacks sell to people they dont know and in public  which makes them vastly easier to arrest Sentencing There is also evidence for Clintons statement that blacks are more likely to get a stiffer sentence than a white person who has been convicted of the same crime and has the same criminal history Studies have shown  for instance  that when prosecutors are deciding on what charges to file against suspects  they tend to select more severe charges for blacks and to use habitual offender laws against blacks more than whites under similar circumstances  particularly when it comes to drug and property crimes  according to a Florida study reported in the journal Criminology A 2013 study in the Yale Law Journal  reported that black men were nearly twice as likely to be charged with an offense that carried a mandatory minimum sentence than white men facing similar circumstances When judges have discretion over how long a sentence should be for a specific crime  they tend to select longer sentences for blacks even if they have the same criminal history After controlling for the arrest offense  a persons criminal history and other characteristics  sentences for black males were about 10 percent higher than for whites  the study found The problem is that as cases work their way through the various steps of the criminal justice system  the degree of the disparity accumulates at each level  said Nazgol Ghandnoosh  a research analyst at the Sentencing Project Youre a little bit more likely to get arrested if youre a person of color than if youre white Youre a little bit more likely to have a higher bail amount to be released Thats going to make it harder for you to get released Youre a little more likely to get a worse plea deal offer  she said As you go through the system  each individual stage makes some small contribution to the overall disparity that we see But its going to be significant as you go through the stages Tonry of the University of Minnesota agreed that sentences are longer for blacks generally  but it depends hugely on what crime youre talking about If its a drug crime thats affected by mandatory minimums  its vastly longer  Tonry said If youre talking about things not subject to mandatory minimums  on average  across the board  blacks probably get sentences that are 5 percent or 10 percent longer than whites do How much of this is due to racism is a matter of debate The experts say poverty may play a major role  but it can be hard to separate the two The best studies try to adjust for the fact that minorities tend to be concentrated in poorer areas  where crime tends to be higher and theres a greater demand for police That can skew the numbers And sentences can be longer for poor people under pressure to cop a plea because they cant afford bail or a good lawyer,0,0,1082,real

Among the most definitive records yet produced on Iraq and weapons of mass destruction is a report from the Iraq Survey Group  a group affiliated with the CIA It released its initial report in 2004 and a concluding addenda in 2005 The report stated that Iraq did not possess weapons of mass destruction during the run up to the US invasion in 2003 The detailed report  which runs more than 1 000 pages  emphasizes that the story of Iraqs weapons is complex and unfolded over many years One complicating factor was Husseins repressive style of leadership  in which he often avoided direct discussion of sensitive military matters Another was his desire to pursue multiple goals that sometimes conflicted with each other After the Persian Gulf War of 1991  for example  Hussein very much wanted to present his country as an imposing military presence to avoid invasion by either the United States or Iran But he also wanted to satisfy weapons inspectors and stop international sanctions that were causing economic problems for his country The report concluded that Hussein did away with his weapons program in the years after the Persian Gulf War  but deliberately encouraged ambiguity about whether his regime possessed the weapons or not Hussein believed the threat of weapons would act as a deterrent to Iran and the United States The report also said that Hussein intended to restart the program after the scrutiny of the international community was off him Though that prospect could have been years off  Hussein kept weapons experts employed in the country for that purpose But  what about Husseins remarks after he was captured? Heres what we know  The Iraq Survey Group interviewed scores of people  including Husseins top advisers After his capture in 2003 by the US government  the survey group gained access to information gleaned from Hussein during detention In 2008  Husseins interrogator for the group  George Piro of the FBI  gave a lengthy interview to Scott Pelley of 60 Minutes in which he discussed what Hussein said while in custody Piro  a native Arabic speaker  said that Hussein told him he wanted to pursue weapons of mass destruction again What weapons of mass destruction did he intend to pursue again once he had the opportunity? Pelley asked He wanted to pursue all of WMD  Piro said So he wanted to reconstitute his entire WMD program Chemical  biological  even nuclear? Pelley asked Yes  Piro said McCains statement was quite specific  He said Hussein intended to acquire weapons  not that he had them Thats what our review of the evidence shows Granted  the evidence was compiled by the US intelligence community  the same group that got the weapons question wrong before the invasion But its the best record publicly available  and it supports McCains statement Hussein told Piro that he did want to pursue weapons of mass destruction someday,4,0,683,real

7293,2013-01-24T17:35:32-05:00,2013,wwwkfforg,Ron DeSantis,The tax penalty that the government imposes if you dont buy health insurance is lower than it would have cost to buy insurance,Following President Barack Obamas second inaugural address  three freshmen Republican members of Congress appeared on Greta Van Susterens Fox News show to offer their reactions The panel focused on the need to address the nations debt problem  but the discussion also turned to a favorite Republican point of attack  Obamacare Ron DeSantis  who represents northeast Florida including St Augustine  Daytona Beach  and areas near Jacksonville  predicted that the health care law will put negative pressure on the insurance market Its structured in a way I think is going to end up failing  DeSantis said The tax that they put on you to buy insurance is lower than it would have cost to buy insurance  so I think a lot of people are going to pay the tax and thats going to destabilize the insurance market And I think you will see problems with increased costs We cant fact check DeSantis prediction  but we were interested in DeSantis claim that the tax penalty imposed by the law is less than the cost of insurance We decided to check it out Whats in the law The laws individual mandate requires most adults in the US to carry insurance coverage or pay a tax penalty The tax is either a specific amount or a percentage of income  whichever is greater  and its phased in over time Here is how the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation summarizes it  Those without coverage pay a tax penalty of the greater of  695 per year up to a maximum of three times that amount   2 085  per family or 25 percent of household income The penalty will be phased in according to the following schedule   95 in 2014   325 in 2015  and  695 in 2016 for the flat fee or 1 percent of taxable income in 2014  2 percent of taxable income in 2015  and 25 percent of taxable income in 2016 Beginning after 2016  the penalty will be increased annually by the cost of living adjustment At most middle income levels  the percentage of income is greater than the flat fee Here are a few examples of what the tax would cost  An individual with  30 000 annual income would pay a  300 penalty in 2014   600 in 2015 and  750 in 2016 An individual with  50 000 annual income would pay a  500 penalty in 2014   1 000 in 2015 and  1 250 in 2016 An individual earning  100 000 a year would pay a  1 000 penalty in 2014   2 000 in 2015 and  2 500 in 2016 Married couples would pay double those amounts since the penalties are assessed per person Families will eventually pay up to  2 085  or 25 percent of household income  by 2016 After 2016  the penalty will be increased annually by the cost of living adjustment The cost of insurance The health care law also establishes insurance exchanges  essentially marketplaces in each state where people can purchase health insurance The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the national average annual premium in an Exchange in 2016 would be about  5 000 for an individual and about  12 000 for a family for the lowest cost coverage that will be available DeSantis office pointed us to another survey which said employer sponsored insurance premiums rose to an average of  5 615 in 2012 for individuals and  15 745 for family coverage  though those figures do not represent what employees themselves paid toward their plans in the form of premiums So its clear that even for those making high incomes    the penalty in 2016 on a  200 000 income would be  4 500    the overall cost of insurance is greater than the tax The point Congressman DeSantis was making is that under Obamacare the penalty intended to force you to buy health insurance is less expensive than the average annual premium In which case  many individuals may opt to pay the penalty instead of purchasing insurance in the marketplace  DeSantis communications director  Amy Graham  told PolitiFact in an email Other views We talked to two experts for their take on DeSantis claim They agreed that dollar for dollar  the tax is less than the cost of insurance But the matter is about more than just the math People buy health insurance for stability  making sure they arent bankrupted by a car accident or heart attack  said Timothy Jost  a law professor who studies health policy at Washington and Lee School of Law who supports the law For a lot of those people theyre going to decide theyd rather pay a bit more for insurance and have something than pay the penalty and be uninsured Clint Stretch  a tax attorney in Washington  also pointed out that the penalty is not meant to be a better deal than health insurance Its meant to nudge the uninsured toward buying coverage Assume an individual could get coverage for  3 000 or not get it and suffer a  1 000 penalty All else being equal  the law has made the decision to buy insurance a  2 000 decision rather than a  3 000 decision  Stretch said in an email In effect the taxpayers choice is pay the Treasury or pay the insurance company   if they pay the Treasury they get no benefit Jost added that many people who are subject to the penalty will benefit from other functions of the health care law  such as Medicaid  the health program for the poor that is expanded under Obamacare There are also tax credits to help people pay for premiums and existing employer sponsored plans If it were just a question of do I pay  2 000  or insurance  or  700  in a tax penalty   yeah thats pretty much a no brainer  Jost said But on the other hand if I can get insurance through my employer for  200 a month and the alternative is not to do that and pay the penalty  it becomes a closer calculation,0,0,989,real
1216,2009-09-28T18:14:44-04:00,2009,barackobamaexperimentcom,Republican National Committee,Barack Obama and the Democrats have proposed a tax for not having health insurance,The Republican National Committee launched a new ad attacking health care reform as a big tax increase Barack Obama and Democrats promise that health care reform will lower costs  but their plans deliver increased taxes  the ad says It then lists several taxes it says the Obama plan will increase Here were checking the claim that theyve even proposed a tax for not having health insurance The ad then flashes to video of Obama and George Stephanopoulos arguing over the meaning of the word tax on This Week with George Stephanopoulos   with Stephanopolous reading the dictionary definition Obama said the measure is necessary to make sure that everyone takes responsibility for having health insurance He also said that a tax penalty is not the same thing as raising peoples taxes The tax in the Democrats bills wont affect anyone who has insurance But if health care reform passes  it will be an issue for those who dont have insurance The tax is the mechanism that Democrats want to use to prod people to get health coverage If they fail to get insurance  they would have to pay it Weve studied the health reform proposals being considered in Congress right now  and the main Democratic versions propose a tax penalty on people who dont carry health insurance Policymakers usually call this provision the individual mandate Among Democrats  there is much consensus that an individual mandate is needed to make sure everyone is covered  especially when coupled with other measures to make affordable coverage more widely available Obama opposed the individual mandate when he was a candidate  but he has since changed his mind and now supports it  as long as it contains a hardship exemption for individuals who are truly unable to find affordable coverage The proposals in Congress each handle the individual mandate differently In the bills in the House of Representatives  a person who failed to get coverage would face a penalty of 25 percent of their modified adjusted gross income up to the cost of basic health insurance  as defined by the new national health insurance exchange The House grants exemptions for dependents  religious objections and financial hardship In the Senate  the Health  Education  Labor and Pension Committee caps the penalty at  750 It exempts residents of states that dont establish health insurance exchanges  those for whom affordable coverage is not available  and those without coverage for fewer than 90 days The Senate Finance Comittee specifies a tax penalty of  950 for an individual and a maximum penalty of  1 900 per family The penalties are a little lower if the persons income is below 300 percent of the poverty level People are exempt from the mandate if they live below the poverty level  if the lowest cost insurance exceeds 10 percent of their income  or if there is financial hardship or religious objections We should note that the bills tend to leave the definitions of financial hardship up to other officials  such as the secretary of Health and Human Services Were going to duck  for now  the question asked by Stephanopolous  about whether Obama is breaking his promise on raising taxes If health reform passes  then well evaluate the mandate with respect to our Obameter campaign promises database  Promise No 515  No family making less than  250 000 will see any form of tax increase  is currently rated Compromise  The details for these mandates are very much a work in progress  and Congress will ultimately have to vote on one set of standards for the mandate But all of the Democratic plans include the mandate  which is a tax penalty on those who dont have insurance The RNC called it a tax for not having health insurance  and theres no doubt that it is a form of tax There are provisions for those who face hardship  but absent special circumstances  everyone will have to have coverage,0,0,649,real
3693,2011-05-04T16:58:27-04:00,2011,abcnewsgocom,David Stockman,Rep Paul Ryans budget proposal cuts nothing from Medicare  Social Security or defense in the next two to three years  and in three years  he does not cut one dime from the debt,President Ronald Reagans former budget director  David Stockman  has taken on a new public role calling out both Democrats and Republicans for failing to address budget deficits quickly  using spending cuts and tax increases Democrats need to accept cuts to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare  Stockman wrote in a recent New York Times op ed  while Republicans should accept tax increases  not only for the rich  but also for the middle class Stockman appeared on the roundtable This Week with Christiane Amanpour on May 1 to make similar arguments Prior to the roundtable  Amanpour interviewed Rep Paul Ryan  R Wisc As the chair of the House Budget Committee  he created a broad budget proposal that the US House of Representatives approved   mostly along party lines  on April 15 Its unlikely the proposal will become law  Senate Democrats and President Barack Obama oppose the plan Stockman didnt have kind words for Ryans outline I think both parties are delusional in thinking that this is a long run problem The Ryan plan gets the balanced budget in 2030  the fiscal hereafter We have a here and now problem  Stockman said Now  what does Ryan do in the next two or three years? Nothing He cuts  600  billion  or  700 billion of spending  mostly from a small part of the budget  discretionary and the safety net  leaves Medicare totally untouched for three years  leaves Social Security totally untouched for 10 years  leaves defense totally untouched for the next three years  and then  after cutting that small amount  gives it all back by extending all the Bush tax cuts that we cant afford  In three years  he does not cut one dime from the debt We decided to fact check Stockmans attack on Ryans proposal Well take it point by point with Truth O Meter rulings along the way to our final ruling Ryans proposal leaves Medicare totally untouched for three years Ryans resolution specifically exempts current retirees and those near retirement This means traditional Medicare would stay in place for those 55 or older So we wouldnt see reductions in the rate of spending on Medicare until about 2022 Ryans budget proposal as passed by the House of Representatives is only a broad outline  but Ryans staff provided additional details of his plan to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office  so that the CBO could conduct its usual fiscal analysis The CBO reported that Ryans plan leaves in place a number of cost saving provisions that are part of health care reform  but those cost savings are part of current law  not new reductions So Ryans budget does indeed leave Medicare alone for the near term Ryans proposal leaves Social Security totally untouched for 10 years Ryans Path to Prosperity asserts that Social Security is out of balance and in fragile condition  but it doesnt suggest any immediate changes to the program Instead  the proposal says the president should submit a plan for restoring balance to the fund  and that members of Congress should also be required to put forth ideas The CBO report plainly states  The proposal does not involve changes to Social Security Ryans proposal leaves defense totally untouched for the next three years Ryans budget proposal accepts cuts already proposed by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates but doesnt suggest additional reductions Ryans budget proposal uses the same numbers for defense spending as the White Houses proposed 2012 budget  though Obama has since suggested  additional cuts to defense The reductions amount to  78 billion over the next five years  a small number considering defense got approximately  720 billion in 2011 alone Ryans budget slows the future growth of defense spending  but he doesnt actually reduce it Ryans proposal says explicitly that the first job of government is national defense and rejects deep  across the board cuts in funding for national defense  On this point  Ryans proposal has attracted critics both for proposing too much and too little A commentator with the libertarian Cato Institute says defense should be cut more   while one from the conservative Heritage Foundation says the spending isnt enough to achieve US security goals  We checked the proposals numbers with Todd Harrison  an expert on the defense budget at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments  a research institute that focuses on defense Even with Gates suggested reduction  the Department of Defense budget would not actually go down    it would essentially stay flat  only growing with inflation  for the next 12 years  Harrison said via e mail We rate this part Mostly True  allowing for the fact that there are some small reductions that Ryan and the Obama administration both agree on In three years  Ryan does not cut one dime from the debt As Stockman noted in his comments  Ryans proposal does cut some discretionary spending in the short term But its not enough to make a dent in the public debt Keep in mind what the debt is  Its the total of all the money weve borrowed The deficit  on the other hand  is the yearly shortfall So making the deficit smaller each year doesnt cut the debt As long as annual deficits exist  the debt will grow every year Ryans proposal reduces deficits but it does not eliminate them until 2040  29 years from now  according to the CBO analysis The Path to Prosperity document includes projections for the public debt between 2011 and 2021  and it shows debt going up every single year Congress is now debating an increase in the debt limit from its current level of  143 trillion  Ryans budget shows the debt increasing to  162 trillion in 2012 and rising every year after that up to  231 trillion in 2021 So Stockmans right on this one  too True Other viewpoints We checked with Ryans office for a response to Stockmans complaints A spokesperson describes Ryans plan as common sense gradual reforms  and pointed out that it reduces deficits compared with current policy and compared with President Obamas budget Economic growth  combined with a real solution to rising health care costs  is the key to putting our budget on a path to balance and our economy on a path to prosperity Tax increases kill growth  and simply cutting benefits for current seniors is not a real solution to rising health care costs  said spokesperson Conor Sweeney via e mail Meanwhile  we should point out that liberal critics who dislike Ryans plan would also disagree with Stockmans critique Short term spending should not be reined in because it would hurt the economic recovery  theyve said Heres how New York Times columnist Paul Krugman put it recently  Why not slash deficits immediately? Because tax increases and cuts in government spending would depress economies further  worsening unemployment And cutting spending in a deeply depressed economy is largely self defeating even in purely fiscal terms  any savings achieved at the front end are partly offset by lower revenue  as the economy shrinks,2,0,1157,real
385,2008-03-03T00:00:00-05:00,2008,wwwnytimescom,Barack Obama,Says Clinton did not read the National Intelligence Estimate before voting for the Iraq war,Trying to counter Sen Hillary Clintons questions about his foreign policy chops  Sen Barack Obama accused the New York senator of bungling the biggest foreign policy vote of her career by authorizing the use of military force against Iraq in 2002 without first reading the National Intelligence Estimate   a forecast by the nations intelligence services of potential developments that could affect national security To underscore his point  Obama noted that former Sen Bob Graham  D Fla  the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence at the time  voted against the resolution  citing dissents in the document  primarily from the State and Energy departments  to intelligence reports that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction If you have a National Intelligence Estimate and the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee says  You should read this  this is why Im voting against the war  you should read it  Obama said in a speech in Westerville  Ohio  on March 1 Obama didnt serve in the Senate when the chamber cleared the use of force resolution  77 23  on Oct 11  2002  but spoke against the war while serving as an Illinois state senator To evaluate the vote on the resolution  one has to consider the ambivalence and fears about war that filled Congress at the time With the memory of the Sept 11 terror attacks fresh in everyones mind  many lawmakers worried that the failure to give Bush the power to act against Iraq would make the United States more vulnerable to further attacks Others were concerned they would be labeled unpatriotic if they voted against a popular president in the weeks before a national election Many who had questioned Bushs talk of war wound up joining in a broad coalition behind the president As a presidential candidate  Clinton has repeatedly said she made a mistake voting for the resolution but also noted that reading the entire National Intelligence Estimate was not a necessity because she and other lawmakers were getting frequent briefings from high level Bush administration officials The book Her Way  The Hopes and Ambitions of Hillary Rodham Clinton   by New York Times reporters Jeff Gerth and Don van Natta Jr  first suggested she did not read the report I was fully briefed by the people who wrote that I was briefed by the people from  you know  the State Department  the CIA  the Department of Defense  all of the various players in that  Clinton said in a Jan 13  2008  appearance on Meet the Press Some people read it and voted for the resolution  some people read it and voted against the resolution I felt very well briefed Clinton sidestepped host Tim Russerts question about whether she read it  but she did not challenge his assertion that she had not Instead  she emphasized that she spoke with the authors of the report The back and forth is casting new attention on the National Intelligence Estimate  versions of which have been prepared since 1946  at the beginning of the Cold War with the Soviet Union The documents are periodically requested by administration officials  military commanders or members of Congress and produced by the National Intelligence Council  which serves as the intelligence communitys forecast center and reports directly to the director of National Intelligence All of the nations intelligence agencies have an opportunity to weigh in on the reports Graham  in a 2005 op ed piece in the Washington Post  said a careful reading of the National Intelligence Estimate revealed it didnt contain the rationale for a pre emptive war in Iraq Graham said he exercised the intelligence committees prerogative during the run up to the war and demanded that then CIA Director George Tenet prepare a classified estimate in September 2002 after learning the White House had not requested one and that none was being prepared The resulting 92 page document  in Grahams opinion  was slanted toward the conclusion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction at 550 sites  but contained what he called vigorous dissents  especially about aluminum tubes that were offered as evidence that Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear program Clinton was far from the only member of Congress to rely on in person briefings instead of actually reading the document To read the report  members of Congress had to go to a secure location in the US Capitol The Washington Post reported in 2004 that no more than six senators and a handful of representatives had logged and read the report beyond a five page executive summary In the end  29 out of 50 Democrats in the chamber voted in favor of the resolution  rejecting arguments by opponents led by Sen Robert C Byrd of West Virginia that it amounted to giving President Bush unlimited authority to wage war  akin to the 1964 Gulf of

Im counting on you to help me with some contacts That e mail and heaps of other information about Reeds ties to Abramoff were unveiled in a 2006 report by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee   which McCain chaired at the time Abramoff arranged for Reed and his companies to receive  53 million to gin up opposition among Christian groups to gambling operations that would have competed with those of Abramoffs tribal clients  the Senate report said Abramoff had each tribe use conduits to implement their grass roots campaigns  the report said Over time  those tribes became accustomed to  1  paying substantial fees for their grass roots activities and  2  paying those fees to or through conduits The vendor that Abramoff and  Abramoffs partner Michael  Scanlon used  and relied on  the most to implement those campaigns was former Christian Coalition Executive Director and political strategist Ralph Reed For example  Reed was hired to help defeat video poker machines at dog tracks  which would have competed with Abramoffs clients casinos Reed boasted in a letter to Abramoff  Century Strategies has on file over 3 000 pastors and 90 000 religious conservative households in Alabama that can be accessed in this effort  the Senate report said Reed did not return calls for comment on the DNCs news release He said in a 2006 statement that he agreed to organize antigambling campaigns only after he was assured he would not be paid with funds derived from gambling Reed subsequently lost a 2006 Republican primary for lieutenant governor of Georgia Reeds name appears 197 times in the Senate report  which ties him to numerous unseemly Abramoff efforts So yes  he was one of Abramoffs closest business partners  and he was plagued by scandal as a result The DNCs news release does not note that the Abramoff Reed partnership and Reeds scandals are in the past  and it could be read to imply that they continue today Strictly speaking  however  the release avoids attaching a tense to its charges about Reed,0,1,777,real

We turned to the Commonwealth Fund study in question  The fund is a 95 year old group that aims to promote a high performing health care system that achieves better access  improved quality  and greater efficiency  particularly for societys most vulnerable  including low income people  the uninsured  minority Americans  young children  and elderly adults The fund is nonpartisan but generally seen as supportive of Obamas law The fund conducted two polls of young Americans    one taken in November 2011  the other taken in February and March 2013 Unlike traditional telephone polls  this survey uses Internet respondents drawn from a sample that  by design  closely mirrors the demographic patterns of the population at large In 2013  the pollsters invited 3 530 adults aged 19 to 29 to complete the 2013 online questionnaire More than half responded  producing a margin of sampling error of slightly more than 3 percentage points Heres a summary of what the pollsters found in 2013 when they asked whether a survey participant age 19 to 25 had  in the past 12 months  opted to stay on or enroll in their parents health plan  So  Clinton was right    63 percent of young Republicans  compared to only 45 percent of young Democrats had signed on to their parents plan  something they couldnt have done without passage of Obamas law Sara R Collins  vice president of Affordable Health Insurance for the Commonwealth Fund  provided us with some additional details about the survey The survey included 1 001 respondents between 19 and 25 who were asked whether they consider themselves Republican  Democrat or Independent Twenty eight percent of respondents  or 285 people  considered themselves Democrats  while 26 percent  or 259 people  self identified as Republicans Because the question Clinton cited only concerned a portion of the people polled  the answers come with a higher margin of error than the overall poll Collins said the Commonwealth Fund did not determine a sampling error for this specific question but found the results statistically significant Put another way  the results are reliable President Clintons statement is accurate  Collins said The difference between young adults who identify as Republicans and those who identify as Democrats enrolled on their parents policies is statistically significant in the survey  A greater share of young adults who identify themselves as Republicans are estimated to have enrolled on their parents plans than did young adults who identified themselves as Democrats For what its worth  the partisan variation was more pronounced in 2013 than it was in 2011 That year  respondents of all three partisan affiliations had much closer rates of signing up for a parents plan    50 percent of Democrats  54 percent of Republicans and 55 percent of Independents,1,0,677,real

6871,2012-10-08T18:17:22-04:00,2012,wwwcnncom,Barack Obama,The federal tax code has loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas,President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have sparred over tax policy for many months They have argued over the treatment of the middle class  small businesses and whether the Bush era tax cuts should be extended for the wealthiest 2 percent The first presidential debate sparked debate on a different point    the taxes paid by companies doing business overseas So far  this topic has not played a prominent role in the campaign  although American based multinational firms have a huge stake in the outcome By one conservative estimate  this part of the tax code is worth  30 billion a year During the debate  Obama tried to score points on Romney by highlighting the tax breaks companies get when they move jobs overseas When it comes to our tax code  Gov Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high  so I want to lower it  particularly for manufacturing  taking it down to 25 percent But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States Romney responded  The idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case In this fact check  well examine the presidents statement and ask if there are tax incentives for companies that set up foreign operations In the narrowest sense possible  Romneys rebuttal is accurate There is no clause in the tax code that rewards a company when it relocates production beyond US borders But if a plant moves at all  whether its from Ohio to Tennessee or Ohio to Malaysia  it is eligible for deductions There is certainly a tax break for US companies that move operations or people abroad  said Gary McGill  director of the Fisher School of Accounting at the University of Florida It is simply a business expense like any other legitimate expense Richard Harvey  a former partner at the accounting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers and now at Villanova School of Law  went even further A company would be arguably negligent if they did not claim the deductions  Harvey said In addition  the current tax law would allow a tax deduction for the costs of shutting down a US operation But both tax experts said the moving expenses were trivial compared to the hefty tax savings that companies can realize after they move their operations There are two provisions in the code that allow them to shelter income from the IRS Tax break  1  Keeping profits overseas When an American firm opens a foreign division  it typically sets up a separate company that does not pay US taxes That foreign subsidiary is a new entity  organized and created in a foreign country  said McGill And responsible for its own taxes Profits earned by the subsidiary need not show up on the parent companys tax return The subsidiary pays taxes in the country where its located Those rates are often lower than in the US  where the corporate rate is 35 percent So long as profits remain overseas  US taxes are deferred The company can declare that none of that money will return to the US McGill  along with colleagues Edmund Outslay and Michael Donohoe  picked apart the public financial statements of Apple and other high tech companies such as Google and IBM With Apple  they found the company had built up  234 billion in earnings the company said would stay overseas permanently And for good reason  Apple was paying an effective tax rate overseas of 12 percent on those profits Tax break  2  Selling to yourself An American firm with a global network of subsidiaries has another way to trim its tax bill All of those companies can buy and sell among themselves Its perfectly legal and very lucrative Take the example of Google In just one quarter  the owner of the worlds most popular search engine had nearly  28 billion in net income and over half of that came from outside the US That would put Google in good shape regardless  but the foreign earnings would be especially valuable In 2009  the companys foreign tax rate was 24 percent  reported Bloomberg News  Google helped keep its taxes low by licensing its algorithms and other digital wizardry to an Irish subsidiary which then sold advertising around the world The Irish tax rate on that income was 4 percent But Google was able to drive its tax bill even lower by creating Google Ireland Holdings based in Bermuda where the tax rate is 06 percent The Irish subsidiary sheltered its income by paying royalties to the subsidiary based in Bermuda These transactions are supposed to cost the same as if they were conducted at arms length Harvey  the former Pricewaterhouse Coopers partner  said they are anything but It is relatively clear most US multinational corporations are aggressively shifting taxable income to low tax jurisdictions  Harvey said I believe that anyone who believes the IRS can effectively enforce the arms length standard is an eternal optimist   or delusional Tallying the cost Harvey said the tax tools that multinationals can use give them a competitive advantage over domestic firms He points to the work of Martin Sullivan  chief economist at Tax Analysts  a nonprofit news service Sullivan told the House Ways and Means Committee that the tax revenues lost through deferral and transfer pricing were worth between  30 billion to  60 billion a year Sullivan also noted that American firms with international operations had shed American jobs while increasing their overseas employment Between 1999 and 2008  US multinational corporations cut their domestic employment by 19 million Over the same period US multinationals increased their employment overseas by 24 million  Sullivan said But the picture is more complicated than that might seem There is strong debate over the role that tax rates play in those job shifts Some analysts  including Harvey  believe the real drivers could be lower wage rates and being closer to important markets around the globe However  regardless of the initial motivation  once companies make the move  in Sullivans words  a toehold of real investment allows a truckload of profit to follow,0,0,1032,real
2881,2010-11-30T16:52:25-05:00,2010,abcnewsgocom,Mike Mullen,Historically  Senate ratification of arms control treaties has been bipartisan,As the House and Senate move into a brief lame duck session before the new Congress begins work in January  one issue on the table is whether the Senate will ratify a new START treaty to control nuclear arms  as the Obama Administration wants The treaty would enact modest nuclear weapons reductions and extend verification provisions that lapsed last year Most Democrats and many foreign policy professionals favor ratification of the new treaty  which would require 67 votes in the Senate But the effort has run into problems with Senate Republicans The Senate Republicans leading spokesman on the issue  Minority Whip Jon Kyl of Arizona  said earlier this month that the lame duck session did not offer enough time to iron out problems he sees with a related issue    US plans for modernizing nuclear forces and infrastructure The administration took up the gauntlet  redoubling its efforts to ratify the treaty this year In an op ed in the Wall Street Journal  Vice President Joe Biden wrote that national security interests are at stake in the ratification battle But Republicans countered that the need for speed was overblown In a separate item   we checked a statement by Kyl on NBCs Meet the Press in which he cited reports by the Washington Post and the Associated Press to justify his position that failure to ratify the new START treaty immediately would not threaten national security Now well take a look at an earlier comment by Adm Mike Mullen   chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff In an interview on ABCs This Week with Christiane Amanpour on Nov 21  2010  the host asked the nations top military officer whether the Senate is playing politics with American national security Mullen responded  Well  youd have to ask the Senate about that Amanpour pressed him  asking  What do you think? Mullen replied  Well  certainly  what I think is that there is a sense of urgency with respect to ratifying this treaty that needs to be  recognized Historically this has been bipartisan This is a national security issue of great significance And the sooner we get it done  the better We wondered whether Mullen is correct that most prior arms control treaties have been passed with bipartisan support We began by determining which treaties we should include in our assessment We turned first to the list of treaties and agreements handled by the State Departments Bureau of Arms Control  Verification and Compliance We only looked at formal treaties  which require a two thirds vote by the Senate in order to be ratified  A quick reminder  Treaties are negotiated and signed by representatives of the president  then ratified by the Senate Once a few additional logistical steps are taken  treaty adherence is made official  We also stuck to treaties that were primarily designed as arms control efforts  particularly when they dealt with weapons of mass destruction    nuclear  biological and chemical By our count  the Senate has ratified 14 such treaties in 13 votes Heres the list in chronological order  along with the year of US ratification and the tally for and against in the Senate    Limited Test Ban Treaty  1963    80 19    Non Proliferation Treaty  1969    83 15   Seven Democrats and eight Republicans voted against    Latin American Nuclear Free Zone Treaty  1971    70 0   Seabed Arms Control Treaty  1972    83 0    Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty  1972    88 2   US later withdrew    Biological Weapons Convention  1974    90 0    Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty  1988    93 5    Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty and Threshold Test Ban Treaty  1990    98 0  to ratify both treaties    Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty  1991    90 4    Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty  also known as START I  1992    93 6   Expired 2009    Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II  also known as START II  1996    87 4    Chemical Weapons Convention  1997    74 26  with 29 Republicans joining 45 Democrats in voting yes and 26 Republicans voting no    Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty  also known as the Moscow Treaty  2003    95 0  This list demonstrates that at least 13 treaties presented to the Senate for ratification passed by overwhelming majorities    and with strong bipartisan support The strongest opposition came in the vote on the Chemical Weapons Convention But the opponents  led by the late Sen Jesse Helms  R NC  could not muster enough support either on amendments to the treaty or the treaty ratification vote itself to derail it An additional historical footnote that bolsters the notion of bipartisanship  Thirteen of the 14 treaties above were ratified when one party held the presidency and the other party held the Senate There is  however  one example of a weapons treaty actually being voted down on the Senate floor In 1999  the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty fell  51 48   with all but four Republicans voting no  Sens John Chafee  R RI  James Jeffords  R Vt  Arlen Specter  R Pa  and Gordon Smith  R Ore  voted for the treaty  along with all Democrats except for Sen Robert Byrd  D WVa  who voted present  In remarks after the Senate vote  President Bill Clinton presaged what some Democrats have argued this month In recent days  members of the Congressional majority have displayed a reckless partisanship  Clinton said It threatens Americas economic well being and now our national security Yesterday  hard line Republicans irresponsibly forced a vote against the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty This was partisan politics of the worst kind because it was so blatant and because of the risks it poses to the safety of the American people and the world So the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is a clear exception to Mullens claim Whether there are additional examples is murkier We found two nuclear related treaties from the Clinton era that were signed but never ratified by the US    the African Nuclear Weapon Free Zone Treaty and the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty But in talking to experts  we found no evidence that either treaty was targeted for opposition based on partisan lines In fact  according to a 1996 Chicago Tribune report  just days after the Clinton Administration signed the African treaty protocols  it clarified that the treaty would not prevent the US from using nuclear weapons against Libya So reservations about the African treaty dont appear to be based on partisanship In addition  the second Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty  or SALT II  was signed by President Jimmy Carter but never ratified While the negotiations over the treaty were somewhat contentious  the immediate reason for not pursuing ratification was the Soviet Unions invasion of Afghanistan in 1980  a rationale that had bipartisan support Another treaty that faced significant partisan opposition was the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea  which failed to advance to a vote in the Senate due to opposition by conservatives who expressed concern about its impact on US

1350,2009-12-02T18:08:25-05:00,2009,frwebgateaccessgpogov,Mitch McConnell,The Senate health care bill does not contain limits on medical malpractice lawsuits,Republicans have a lot of concerns about the Senate health care bill  and one of their biggest is that it does not include any language to rein in lawsuits against doctors On Day 2 of the chambers health care debate  Republican leader Mitch McConnell spoke about the issue on the Senate floor as he encouraged colleagues to send the bill back to committees for some major changes Then we could start over and end junk lawsuits against doctors and hospitals that drive up costs  something the majority didnt find any room for in their 2 074 page bill   not a word about controlling junk lawsuits against doctors and hospitals  McConnell said Dec 1  2009 That claim has been echoed by other conservatives  including Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer Their argument for limiting malpractice cases or their awards   supporters call it tort reform   involves saving money If doctors are not scared of being sued  theyre less likely to order unnecessary tests and procedures for their patients  thus reducing medical costs Indeed  a Congressional Budget Office report from 2004 says health care premiums have risen recently in part because insurance companies have faced increased costs to pay for claims  from growth in malpractice awards  More recently  the independent budget office said that medical malpractice reform could save up to  54 billion over the next 10 years President Barack Obama addressed the issue at a June meeting of the American Medical Association  saying  I recognize that it will be hard to make some of these changes if doctors feel like theyre constantly looking over their shoulders for fear of lawsuits  I understand some doctors may feel the need to order more tests and treatments to avoid being legally vulnerable Nevertheless  Obama said malpractice awards should not be capped  as many Republicans want  because he believes the caps can be unfair to people who are wrongfully harmed Former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean  a physician  gave some insight into the issue when it came up in a Virginia town hall meeting last summer Heres why tort reform is not in the bill  When you go to pass a really enormous bill like that the more stuff you put in it the more enemies you make  Dean said The reason tort reform is not in the bill is because the people who wrote it did not want to take on the trial lawyers in addition to everyone else they were taking on  and that is the plain and simple truth So  Democrats have not included medical malpractice limits in either the House or Senate version of the bills Instead  the administration has said it will give some states  3 million grants to test new approaches for limiting lawsuits The two bills dont completely ignore the issue The Senate bill includes nonbinding sense of the Senate language on page 1 858 that states should be encouraged to develop and test alternatives to the existing civil litigation system as a way of improving patient safety  reducing medical errors  encouraging the efficient resolution of disputes  while preserving an individuals right to seek redress in court The House bill establishes an incentive for states to adopt alternatives to traditional malpractice lawsuits  but those proposals cannot include provisions to limit attorney fees or impose caps on damages So  back to McConnells claim He said that the Senate bill does not include limits on medical malpractice litigation  and he is clearly correct,0,0,572,real

Biles said In testimony before the House of Representatives on June 28  2007  CBO director Peter R Orszag said Medicare is  in effect  subsidizing the added cost of the Medicare Advantage program But is it better? Orszag wasnt convinced Many Medicare Advantage plans offer disease management  care coordination  and preventive care programs  but little information is available on the degree to which the plans generate better health outcomes than the traditional Medicare program  he said The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if the government refused to pay MA plans more than traditional Medicare costs  that the taxpayers would save  95 billion in 2009   54 billion over the 2009 2012 period  and  150 billion over 10 years It was that last projection that Obama apparently used to come up with his  15 billion figure Joseph Antos  a health policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute  believes that if the additional money paid for MA plans is eliminated or severely reduced  half the plans will drop out in two years That wont sit well with people in those plans  he said  and its likely to be strongly opposed by congressmen from rural districts   Republicans and Democrats alike   who have a high percentage of constituents in the MA program Antos also takes issue with Obamas characterization of the extra money paid for MA as giveaways to insurance companies In general  the extra money that goes to these plans ends up benefiting the beneficiaries to some extent  Anton said The programs tend to have a lower co payment for prescription drugs and premiums for medical services Does some of that stick to their  insurance company  fingers  of course  Antos said Its Obamas interpretation when he calls the added payments for MA programs insurance company subsidies or giveaways But Obama is on solid ground when he estimates that the government spends about  15 billion a year extra on the private MA program than on traditional Medicare  particularly as we move forward in coming years,2,0,839,real
4787,2011-11-15T10:23:59-05:00,2011,cqcom,Ron Paul,Torture is illegal by our laws Its illegal by international laws,During the CBS National Journal Republican presidential debate in Spartanburg  SC   on Nov 12  2011  one of the moderators  Major Garrett  invited Rep Ron Paul  R Texas  into a discussion of torture Both Rep Michele Bachmann  R Minn  and former Godfathers Pizza executive Herman Cain had already said they favored allowing interrogators to use waterboarding    the practice of simulating drowning to elicit information from a detainee Waterboarding was permitted under the George W Bush administration  but the policy was rescinded soon after President Barack Obama took office Congressman Paul  Garrett said  my fighting sense tells me we have a debate about to get launched here I know you have an opinion and would like to weigh in Paul responded  Yes  torture is illegal by our laws Its illegal by international laws The exchange attracted significant attention following the debate Obama was asked about it at a news conference in Hawaii He responded that that Bachmann and Cain are among those who are wrong Waterboarding is torture Its contrary to Americas traditions Its contrary to our ideals Thats not who we are Thats not how we operate We dont need it in order to prosecute the war on terrorism And we did the right thing by ending that practice Meanwhile  Sen John McCain  R Ariz  who ran against Obama in the 2008 presidential campaign  tweeted   Very disappointed by statements at SC GOP debate supporting waterboarding Waterboarding is torture We wondered whether Paul was right that torture is illegal under US and international law So we decided to check First  however  we should note that many    though not all    observers consider waterboarding to be a form of torture Well address that issue more fully in a moment For now  let s stick to Pauls specific claim Is torture illegal under US law? Yes  under several different portions of the law   A provision of US law  18 USC 2340  that took effect in 1994 makes torture a crime The law defines torture as an act committed by a person acting under the color of law specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering  other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions  upon another person within his custody or physical control   A different provision on war crimes addresses torture as well  18 USC 2441  The provision reads  Whoever  whether inside or outside the United States  commits a war crime  shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for life or any term of years  or both  and if death results to the victim  shall also be subject to the penalty of death  As used in this section  the termwar crime  includes   torture    Finally  as we noted here   two days after taking office  Obama issued a detailed executive order on torture and related issues The executive order said that prisoners shall in all circumstances be treated humanely and shall not be subjected to violence to life and person  including murder of all kinds  mutilation  cruel treatment  and torture   nor to outrages upon personal dignity  including humiliating and degrading treatment  It also specifically nullifies interpretations of federal law on interrogations issued by the Department of Justice between September 11  2001  and January 20  2009 under President George W Bush The executive order brings the CIA into line with US Army Field Manual on Interrogation  said said Tom Malinowski  Washington director for Human Rights Watch This limits interrogators to humane techniques  a standard that already applies as a matter of law to the US military  he said Is torture illegal under international law? This is also a correct statement   The Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel  Inhuman  or Degrading Treatment of Punishment  the Torture Convention  was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on Dec 10  1984 and entered into force on June 26  1987  after it had been ratified by 20 states The United States ratified the convention on Oct 21  1994 It defines torture as any act by which severe pain or suffering  whether physical or mental  is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession  punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed  or intimidating or coercing him or a third person  or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind  when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity   The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights This United Nations agreement    approved on Dec 16  1966  and entered into force on March 23  1976    says in part that no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment The United States ratified it in June 8  1992   The Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War This convention entered into force on Oct 21  1950  and the United States ratified it on Feb 8  1955 It bars at any time and in any place whatsoever all violence to life and person  in particular murder of all kinds  mutilation  cruel treatment and torture of persons taking no active part in  hostilities  including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by sickness  wounds  detention  or any other cause   Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War This convention   This convention was entered into force on Oct 21  1950  and the United States ratified it on Feb 8  1955 and is virtually identical to the separate Geneva convention above   Universal Declaration of Human Rights This declaration   drafted by a committee that included former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt  is not technically a treaty  but it does carry some weight in international law It was ratified by the United Nations General Assembly on Dec 10  1948  by a vote of 48 0 with eight abstentions The United States was one of the nations voting in favor of the declaration  which says that no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment What constitutes torture? So Paul is on solid ground when he says that torture is illegal  by our laws Its illegal by international laws But as we indicated  theres a significant caveat    not everyone agrees on what constitutes torture No one will dispute Rep Pauls statement  said Steven Groves  a fellow at the Heritage Foundation What is in dispute is whether certain interrogation techniques are consideredtorture under either the US or international definition of that term This is an especially important point given that Pauls comment came in the context of a discussion of waterboarding Many legal experts believe that waterboarding qualifies as torture under many if not all of the legal definitions cited above But the Bush administration and its supporters strongly disagreed  calling waterboarding an enhanced interrogation technique and thus falling outside of the definition of torture An Aug 1  2002  memo by Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee and another memo dated the same day by Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo sought to set a very high threshold as to what constitutes severepain or suffering  said Anthony Clark Arend  professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University These interpretations were overturned by Obamas Jan 22  2009  executive order But the controversy rages on    as the Republican debate in South Carolina demonstrates We wont seek to referee this question here  but we do think its important to note that some    though by no means all    observers would consider Pauls comment to be a non sequitur because of their position that waterboarding is not torture,3,0,1290,real

Fehrnstrom answered  Well  I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign Everything changes Its almost like an Etch A Sketch You can kind of shake it up and we start all over again As expected  Romneys opponents pounced Gingrich and Santorum both held up the perennial childrens toy as props at campaign appearances Democrats cranked out ads capitalizing on the line  which provided an almost too easy inroad to raising questions    again    about Romneys firmness on issues Here well check one such ad   put out by the Democratic super PAC American Bridge 21st Century   which suggests that Romney has flip flopped on abortion First  the toy In case you skipped childhood  well tell you a bit about the Etch A Sketch First manufactured in the 1950s  the Etch A Sketch is a flat tablet with a red frame  gray face and two white knobs for drawing    like an iPad from the paleolithic period The two knobs draw vertical and horizontal lines on the screen as theyre turned  and those with superior hand eye coordination are said to be able to make curving lines For most Etch A Sketchers  though  a side view of a staircase qualifies as a masterpiece The feature Fehrnstrom analogized was its reusability When youre done drawing  you flip it over and shake it up Little beads rattle around inside to clear the screen  and Voila! You once again have a blank canvas Now  the ad The ad was produced by American Bridge 21st Century  a Democratic super PAC In the ad  released the same day as Fehrnstroms comment  a clip of his interview plays  including the Etch A Sketch comment Then the toy appears  with the words Romney on the issues above it Music that sounds like its coming from a jack in the box plays in the background The first quote attributed to Romney appears on the Etch A Sketch screen  I support a womans right to choose Then the Etch A Sketch shakes  the words vanish and the next quote appears I believe strongly in protecting life The ad goes on to portray Romneys apparent flip flops on the NRA and his loyalty to Ronald Reagan  PolitiFact has looked into similar accusations before See our checks here on the NRA and here on Reagan  For this fact check  well see if the two abortion quotes are accurate We found a Boston Globe story from May  1994  when Romney was in a primary battle for US Senate At the time  he said he supported abortion rights and the right to privacy established by Roe v Wade But even then  opponents accused him of being a pro choice pretender Following a debate with opponent John Lakian  Romney defended an endorsement he had received from Massachusetts state treasurer Joe Malone  an abortion opponent Lakian had said Malone backed him to reward the pro life contingent that was very much in Mitts camp at the convention  according to the Globe Romney responded  The idea that somehow Joe Malone endorsed me because hes pro life despite the fact that I support a womans right to choose doesnt follow very well Thats the only quote from Romney we found that matches American Bridges ad verbatim Numerous other statements hes made  however  express the same sentiment For one  in a debate later in the 1994 race against Democratic Sen Edward Kennedy  Romney said  I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country And  I believe that since Roe v Wade has been the law for 20 years  it should be sustained and supported And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice For another  in his 2002 campaign for governor  Romney said during a debate  I will preserve and protect a womans right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard The second Romney quote in American Bridges ad reflects his changed stance on the issue I believe strongly in protecting life  the ad says We could find no instance of Romney saying those exact words American Bridges spokesman Chris Harris told us the quotes were paraphrased so they fit on a small Etch A Sketch screen We ensured they were airtight  accurate portrayals of his positions  both past and present Its well documented that Romneys past and present positions on abortion differ from each other In a June 18  2011  op e d in the conservative National Review Romney laid out his views  I am pro life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape  incest  or to save the life of the mother I support the reversal of Roe v Wade  because it is bad law and bad medicine Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench I support the Hyde Amendment  which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions And as president  I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood  which primarily performs abortions or offers abortion related services I believe people understand that Im firmly pro life  he said in a debate that same month In October 2011 he told former Arkansas Gov Mike Huckabee on Fox News  Id make sure that the progress that has been made to provide for life and to protect human life is not progress that would be reversed Finally  we have examined Romneys shifting position on abortion when others have made the accusation In each case  we rated the charge True  Please see our source list ,1,1,1095,real

For this check  were looking specifically at what Obama campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter said on Face the Nation when debating Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom You know  I heard Mitt Romney deride the  700 billion cuts in Medicare that the president achieved through health care reform  Cutter said You know what those cuts are? Its taking subsidies away from insurance companies  taking rebates away from prescription drug company Is that what Mitt Romney wants to protect? And interestingly enough Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget Its a lot to digest if youre not already a Medicare policy wonk  so let us sort it out for you For now  we are going to put aside the question of whether it is accurate to call them cuts    a claim were checking in another item    and focus on the question of whether Cutter is correct that Ryan relies on those same reductions in his budget  700 billion in Medicare cuts? Because were wonks ourselves at PolitiFact  our ears pricked up at the claim in recent days that Obama cut  700 billion out of Medicare Just a few weeks ago  the oft cited number was  500 billion How did he manage to cut another  200 billion when no one was looking? Well  there are cuts and then there are CUTS Neither Obama nor his health care law literally cut a dollar from the Medicare programs budget Rather  the health care law instituted a number of changes to reduce the growth of Medicare costs At the time the law was passed  those reductions amounted to  500 billion over the next 10 years What kind of spending reductions are we talking about? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals  not beneficiaries The law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage  a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers Medicare Advantage was started under President George W Bush  and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers Hospitals  too  will be paid less if they have too many re admissions  or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care Still  the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future The health care law tries to limit that growth  making it less than it would have been without the law  but not reducing its overall budget So claims that Obama would cut Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate In the past  weve rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False  depending on the wording and context Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year  the cost saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger Also  it takes a few years for the health care laws savings mechanisms to kick in In fact  the effects of time are the main reason the  500 billion number has turned into  700 billion The CBO determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by  507 billion between 2012 and 2021 In a more recent estimate released this year  the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by  716 billion So its timing thats making the cuts bigger  not changes to Medicare Does the Ryan budgetprotect those cuts? Now onto our second question  Does Ryans budget keep the reductions in Medicare spending? The short answer is yes Heres what Ryan said in an interview with George Stephanopolous of ABC News in June  before his selection as Romneys running mate  Stephanopoulos  You know  several independent fact checkers have taken a look at that claim  the  500 billion in Medicare cuts  and said that its misleading And in fact  by that accounting  your budget  your own budget  which Gov Romney has endorsed  would also have  500 billion in Medicare cuts Ryan  Well  our budget keeps that money for Medicare to extend its solvency What Obamacare does is it takes that money from Medicare to spend on Obamacare    Read the full exchange   So Ryan has confirmed his budget includes the Medicare savings The Romney campaign got questions on this point the day after Cutters remarks  and issued a statement saying that Romney intended to fully repeal the federal law  including the savings for Medicare Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have always been fully committed to repealing Obamacare  ending President Obamas  716 billion raid on Medicare  and tackling the serious fiscal challenges our country faces  said Lanhee Chen  Romneys policy director  in a statement reported by NBC News  A Romney Ryan administration will restore the funding to Medicare  ensure that no changes are made to the program for those 55 or older  and implement the reforms that they have proposed to strengthen it for future generations Cutter  though  was talking about the Ryan budget We should point out that the Ryan budget is a congressional resolution that doesnt have the force of law And its plan for Medicare hasnt been turned into legislation that could be analyzed in detail by the Congressional Budget Office Still  Ryan himself said his plan did include the reductions in future spending that were part of the federal health care law Thats because both sides agree on one point  Medicare spending is growing too rapidly  and it needs to reined in,7,1,1091,real
1314,2009-11-11T19:28:28-05:00,2009,clerkhousegov,Loretta Sanchez,The House of Representatives does not have a prochoice majority,One of the more interesting twists in health care reform came on a recent vote in the House of Representatives on abortion coverage An amendment restricting abortion coverage authored by Rep Bart Stupak  a Democrat from Michigan  won the votes of all Republicans and 64 Democrats to become part of the health care reform bill passed by the House on Saturday His measure further tightened rules about how insurers could offer abortion coverage  requiring them to offer separate policies in many instances  Read our detailed explanation of the Stupak amendment here   Abortion rights advocates should not have been surprised  said Rep Loretta Sanchez  a Democrat from California  on the MSNBC show Morning Joe  Sanchez  who favors abortion rights  said that progressives are really angry because they believe poor women should have the choice to get an abortion if they want one On the other hand  we have to acknowledge that the House of Representatives is not a majority prochoice  Sanchez said And Ive told that to a lot of pro choice groups I would count maybe about 150 prochoice votes You need 218 to get to pass a bill We wanted to know if Sanchez was correct that the House of Representatives is not majority prochoice We first turned to an organization that favors abortion rights NARAL Pro Choice America rates members of Congress and has compiled its own profile of the current Congress It labeled 185 members prochoice Then we turned to the National Right to Life Committee  a group that opposes abortion It doesnt rate the entire Congress in the same way  but the group has rated four abortion votes during the current Congress and created percentage ratings for each member A 100 percent rating means a member fully agreed with the positions of National Right to Life  a 0 percent rating means they did not agree at all We crunched the numbers  looking for members who never voted with the position of National Right to Life    185  the same as  NARALs prochoice members Other numbers tend to support Sanchezs conclusion  but they also reveal the complexity of the issue and the fact that every member doesnt fall neatly into a yes or no category NARAL labeled 203 members antichoice National Right to Life gave only 179 members 100 percent ratings NARAL labeled 47 members mixed choice  while National Right to Life found that 71 members voted with the group some of the time So do those numbers add up to the conclusion that there isnt a prochoice majority in the House? NARAL spokesman Ted Miller agreed with Sanchezs comments It is accurate to state that antichoice lawmakers outnumber our prochoice allies  Miller said in an e mail interview While the numbers are challenging  we have managed to win some key votes this session  family planning vote and lifting DC abortion ban  by gaining support from some mixed  and even antichoice members National Right to Life spokesman Douglas Johnson  on the other hand  downplayed the idea that antiabortion sentiment is growing in the House His side does win some votes  he said  and the Stupak amendment was the clearest vote on abortion that weve had in the current Congress But he doubts that Congress would overturn the US Supreme Court decision Roe vs Wade   a major precedent establishing abortion rights If you had a vote in the House on whether or not to overturn Roe vs Wade   I believe that the majority would affirm that they would support it  Johnson said In fact  a few members of Congress who voted for the Stupak amendment otherwise receive low ratings from National Right to Life We counted 34 members who voted with the group on Stupaks amendment but against it on other issues Indeed  the Stupak amendment represents a classic gray area  The measure does not forbid insurers from covering abortion  but it requires them to offer separate policies for people who pay for plans with their own money  as opposed to those who pay part of their premiums with government subsidies  Those who favor abortion rights say this will discourage insurers from offering coverage that includes abortion  and perhaps it will But thats a business decision on the part of the insurers  not a government prohibition We should add here that the Stupak amendment might not make it to the final bill  once the Senate considers its own version of health care reform Getting back to Sanchezs statement  She said  the House of Representatives is not a majority prochoice Her claim is supported by counts from both sides that show only 185 members are solidly in favor of abortion rights Its worth noting that the number of antiabortion House members is less than a majority  too But as for Sanchezs claim  she is right,1,0,795,real
4875,2011-12-01T15:38:11-05:00,2011,wwwwhitehousegov,Barack Obama,For the average middle class family  your taxes today are lower than when I took office,During a Nov 30  2011  speech in Scranton  Pa  President Barack Obama urged Congress to extend a payroll tax cut He used the platform to try to change perceptions about his stance on taxes Now  I know you hear a lot of folks on cable TV claiming that Im this big tax and spend liberal  Obama said Next time you hear that  you just remind the people who are saying it that since Ive taken office  Ive cut your taxes  The average middle class family  your taxes today are lower than when I took office  just remember that We have cut taxes for small businesses not once  not twice  but 17 times The average familys tax burden is among the lowest its been in the last 60 years So the problem is not that weve been raising taxes  Weve actually been trying to give families a break during these tough times A couple readers asked us to check this item One wrote us  Ive seen conservative reactions ranging from I laughed out loud toWhat a comedian! So we decided to take a look Weve addressed two of these claims in previous items    the one about small business tax cuts  rating it Mostly True   and the one about the tax burden being the lowest in 60 years  rating it Mostly True   So in this item  were only analyzing Obamas claim that for the average middle class family  your taxes today are lower than when I took office First  lets recap some background about the tax  and the tax cut  that Obama was touting in Scranton The payroll tax refers to federal taxes taken directly from the paychecks of employed Americans It is primarily used to fund Social Security and Medicare For two decades  the payroll tax meant a 62 percent deduction on annual earnings for most workers There were limits to the total amount individuals could be required to pay In 2009 and 2010  the levy applied to the first  106 800 of salary  meaning no one would pay more than  6 621 Employers paid a matching share In December 2010  the levy was cut to 42 percent for workers as part of an agreement Obama worked out with Congress to extend income tax reductions passed during President George W Bushs administration The payroll tax reduction is in effect for the duration of 2011 But in his American Jobs Act   Obama proposed slicing the payroll to 31 percent for workers next year  To help employers  the president also proposed a 50 percent tax cut in the first  5 million of payroll costs for most small businesses  Obama has also enacted some other tax cuts while in office  including the American Opportunity Tax Credit for tuition and other educational fees and expansions of the existing Earned Income Tax Credit and child tax credit Hes also raised some taxes  or didnt stop them from going up   but these hikes arent as relevant for judging his statement in Scranton Some of the tax hikes havent taken effect yet  like a few in the health care bill  so these wouldnt be a factor in judging the statement that for the average middle class family  your taxes today are lower than when I took office Other tax increases affect only very wealthy taxpayers Two taxes would be relevant for this calculation Obama signed legislation raising taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products soon after taking office  that money goes to pay for childrens health insurance programs The law went into effect in 2009 He also signed the health care law  which includes taxes on indoor tanning that went into effect last year Its hard to tell exactly whos footing the burden for these taxes However  cigarette and tanning taxes account for a relatively small share of all federal taxes  and zero for people who dont use either of them  The broadest analyses weve seen are the tax analyses produced by the Urban Institute Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center  an independent research organization We looked at the groups estimate of what tax burden is borne by Americans of different income levels The group calculates the average federal tax burden and the average federal tax rate for five quintiles of US households    or 20 percent groupings  from the top of the income scale to the bottom These figures include the federal income tax  payroll taxes  and estate taxes  though not federal excise taxes or corporate taxes  The tax rate figure is the effective tax rate    how much the average taxpayer ultimately pays as a percentage of their cash income Its not a tax bracket  which refers to the income tax rate paid on a taxpayers final dollar of income  To come up with a definition of middle class  we ignored the top 20 percent and the bottom 20 percent and focused on the three segments of 20 percent each in the middle of the income distribution We used the tax data for 2008 and for 2011 So how do the numbers look? Heres the summary Second lowest 20 percent 2008 tax burden   1 715 2011 tax burden   1 396 Decline of  319 2008 tax rate  67 percent 2011 tax rate  57 percent Decline of 1 percentage point Middle 20 percent 2008 tax burden   6 290 2011 tax burden   5 535 Decline of  775 2008 tax rate  136 percent 2011 tax rate  124 percent Decline of 12 percentage points Second highest 20 percent 2008 tax burden   13 749 2011 tax burden   13 078 Decline of  671 2008 tax rate  174 percent 2011 tax rate  165 percent Decline of 09 percentage points So for each of the three middle quintiles  both the amount of tax paid and the effective tax rate paid declined,1,1,953,real

If true  that would be pretty startling As it turns out  median income has fallen  once you take inflation into account Here are the details In September 2014  the US Census Bureau published its annual roundup of data on income and poverty  Table A 2 in the report provides data on the inflation adjusted  median household income for the most recent 10 years  This shows that  despite a slight uptick between 2012 and 2013  real median household income has fallen since the start of the recovery in 2009 by  2 120 Thats about 4 percent  or roughly 1 percent per year  every year The only caveat we should mention is that the most recent data stops at the end of 2013  and we dont know yet whether income gains accelerated enough in 2014 to make up for the losses between 2009 and 2013 Still  we wont mark down Bush for this  since he was using the most current data available Its sad but true that real median income is below what it was in 2009 and 2010  said Tara Sinclair  a George Washington University economist Real median income kept dropping well after the official end of the recession and has been pretty close to flat since 2011 She added that the losses have not been experienced equally Incomes  Sinclair noted  have fallen in the lower parts of the income distribution  whereas the the top 10 percent of the income spectrum  and even more elite segments  have experienced gains Still  Bush was clearly speaking about the overall national picture  so we find no fault with his claim,1,0,435,real

A description of the ad on the Romney campaigns YouTube channel says  In 1996 and 2004  Rick Santorum supported Arlen Specter over conservative candidates We decided wed dig back 16 years to check  Did Santorum support Specter over conservative candidates twice? We reached out to campaigns for Romney and Santorum  in addition to Specter  now adjunct faculty at University of Pennsylvania Law School None responded by our deadline But there was plenty written as history unfolded to help us judge this claim Santorums 1996 endorsement The first flashback takes us to the mid 90s  when Sen Arlen Specter  65  hopped briefly into the Republican race for president Santorum  37  was a freshly minted senator  elected in 1994 with a helping hand from Specter   who swallowed his opposition to the conservative  pro life House member to ensure a Republican win over Democratic Sen Harris Wofford It wasnt like Arlen wanted Rick He didnt But when he won the primary  he rallied around him  said Terry Madonna  an expert in Pennsylvania politics with Franklin and Marshall College In 1995  as the junior senator from Pennsylvania  Santorum returned the favor  appearing on stage supporting his home state colleague while Specter announced his candidacy for president  So  the 1996 endorsement was in 1995  but for Specters short lived attempt to face Bill Clinton in the 1996 presidential race  Did Santorum support Specter over conservative candidates? According to news coverage at the time  Specter said he was entering the race to challenge the partys religious conservatives and speak in favor of abortion rights He attacked conservative primary rivals during his speech   conservative commentator Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed  leaders of the Christian Coalition    with Santorum on stage The New York Times said   So pronounced was Mr Specters attack that he spoke this line twice Neither this nation nor this party can afford a Republican candidate so captive to the demands of the intolerant right that we end up re electing a president of the incompetent left Santorum  for his part  didnt play his supporting role flawlessly The Times reporter noted that he rolled his eyes more than once and limited his applause A few days later  Santorum was quoted by States News Service  Santorum repeated his support of Sen Arlen Specters presidential candidacy  but it was hardly a ringing endorsement The reason I endorse Sen Specter is because I work with him everyday  Santorum said He then added  and I think we agree on most things Santorums 2004 endorsement Santorums second endorsement of Specter was more recent   and has a more infamous   history A Washington Post blog recently called it  Rick Santorums greatest sin  Conservative Pat Toomey challenged Specter in the GOP primary Republican leadership  fearing Toomey would struggle in a general election  lined up behind centrist Specter  starting with President George W Bush Santorum  who by 2004 ranked No 3 in the Senate as the Republican Conference chairman   a job focused on keeping Republican seats   toed the line With conservative backing  Specter just survived  keeping his Senate seat one more term However  Santorum opposed Specter in other ways  such as in Senate votes over social issues In 2004  Specters voting record got just a 43 percent approval rating from the American Conservative Union  the Bulletin News Frontrunner report noted In 2010  Santorums lifetime ACU rating was 88 percent  according to National Review On social stuff  he and Arlen were on very different planets  said Madonna  the Pennsylvania politics expert In fact  most coverage of Santorums endorsement of Specter noted how their politics differed For example  a 2004 Campaign   Elections article headlined  The Power of Endorsements  noted  Specter was helped by the endorsement of Santorum  his Senate colleague who is considerably more conservative The men differed over abortion and stem cell research  among other issues Santorum played down the differences in backing the incumbent and emphasized their agreement on judicial nominations and other issues In a television commercial Santorum said Ive heard people say they think Arlen Specter is a liberal Well  let me tell you   Arlen is with us on the votes that matter During the six year term won with help from Bush and Santorum  Specter switched his party allegiance and began to caucus with Democrats Although the ad describes Specter as a  liberal  pro choice Republican turned Democrat  Santorums endorsements of Specter all occurred when Specter was a Republican In 2010  Specter ran as a Democrat  and lost in the primary,3,0,869,real

Indeed  Obamas remarks mirror the advice from the Centers for Disease Control almost perfectly When it comes to preventing the flu  the CDC recommends the following    Avoid close contact   Stay home when you are sick   Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing   Clean your hands   Avoid touching your eyes  nose or mouth   Practice good health habits  like getting lots of sleep  getting exercise  and eating nutritious food We also found numerous independent scientific studies that found handwashing significantly reduced the transmission of disease  including the MRSA bacteria and the flu The University of Michigan School of Public Health is in the midst of a two year study examining whether face masks and handwashing can reduce the transmission of the flu The study tracked the spread of flu among college students in university dorms  and used a control group to compare outcomes Initial results indicate that face masks and hand sanitizing reduced the transmission rate of the flu by as much as 50 percent But knowing you should wash your hands and doing it are two different things And putting your hands under the faucet for three seconds and then wiping them on your slacks doesnt count Consumers Union  the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports magazine  has been trying to raise awareness of the importance of handwashing in hospitals Studies show that doctors and health care workers wash their hands only about half the time they should before examining patients  said Lisa McGiffert  the director of the groups Stop Hospital Infections campaign Some people think that this is such a simple thing that it couldnt make a difference But it does  McGiffert said This is what the experts have been trying to get health care workers and doctors to do for decades  and it does make it difference Hand sanitizers are a good substitute for handwashing  and coughing into your arm is better than coughing into your hand  she said To make sure youve washed your hands thoroughly  sing Happy Birthday  silently  please  When the song is over  youve washed long enough And regular soap works just fine Obama said that handwashing and covering your mouth when you cough can make a huge difference The scientific consensus on handwashing backs him up,1,0,570,real
961,2009-03-18T17:27:19-04:00,2009,ideasecgov,Elijah Cummings,AIG said they were giving  57 million  in retention payments  to people who were being terminated,Often lost in the raging debate over  165 million in bonuses paid to AIG employees   amid a  170 billion taxpayer funded bailout   is the fact that these were not performance bonuses  they were retention awards Essentially  they were payments made to employees to keep them from leaving the crumbling company Rep Elijah E Cummings  D Md  has been railing against the retention bonuses for months  but this week he came across a line in a recent AIG filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that really galled him Keep in mind  in their filings   AIGs recent filings   they said they were giving  57 million to people who were being terminated  Cummings said in an interview on ABCs Good Morning America on March 16 I mean  that goes in the opposite direction of retention And I really do think the American people are being played for fools by AIG Sure enough  if you go to page 222 of AIGs 10 K filing last month  youll find this line  Restructuring expenses include  44 million of retention awards and Total amount expected to be incurred includes  57 million for retention awards for employees expected to be terminated What? Retention bonuses to people you dont plan toyou knowretain? As part of restructuring the company  we will ultimately eliminate jobs that are  at the moment  critical to maintaining ongoing operations and winding down certain businesses  Christina Pretto  an AIG spokeswoman  told Bloomberg To have one of these positions obviously implies an uncertain future  and creates an incentive to leave the company To retain such mission critical people  we are making retention payments to them In all  AIG committed to  1 billion worth of retention payments In a Dec 5  2008  letter to  Rep Cummings  AIG chairman and CEO Edward Liddy said retaining key employees is critical for the company to maintain its standing in the eyes of reinsurers and rating agencies  and ultimately is essential for AIG to recoup as much as it can for taxpayers We would be doing a disservice to the taxpayer   and would place AIGs asset divestiture plan at risk   if we did not act decisively to ensure that our key employees remain with the company  said Liddy  who took over the reins at AIG in September at the governments request With the company posting monstrous losses  we should note that these retention payments will essentially be paid through the infusion of cash from the taxpayer funded bailouts At the moment  the retention payments that have drawn the most scorn are those to employees in the financial products division  the folks that got the insurance conglomerate into the deep mess its currently in Those agreements predate the company bailouts by the federal government Back in April 2008 and due to the declining market environment  the company established an employee retention plan with financial products employees to manage and unwind its complex business  according to SEC filings An installment payment on those retention bonuses came due on March 15 to the tune of  165 million Thats the payment that triggered the recent political storm According to a letter sent by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo to House Financial Services Charman Barney Frank on March 17  73 employees got retention bonuses of  1 million or more  and 11 of them are no longer working at AIG  including one who got  46 million  In all  the New York attorney generals office found that 52 of the 418 employees who got the retention bonuses have left the company Liddy said the retention bonuses amounted to going to those employees and saying  You have a job That jobs going to go away after you wind down the book of business that you manage If youll stay In a congressional hearing on March 18  Frank asked if those who got retention bonuses and then left had to give back their bonus No  Liddy said The arrangement is  if you stay  wind down your particular business  do a good job of it  and were comfortable with the job youve done  youll get that retention bonus Im trying desperately to prevent an uncontrolled collapse of that business  Liddy said This is the only way to improve AIGs ability to pay taxpayers back quickly and completely and the only way to avoid a systemic shock to the economy that the US government help was meant to relieve Make no mistake Had I been CEO at the time  I would never have approved the retention contracts that were put in place over a year ago It was distasteful to have to make these payments  but we concluded that the risk to the company and  therefore  the financial system in the economy  were unacceptably high And if not paid  we ran the risk that we would have happen what everyone has worked so hard thus far not to have happen Liddy said he has since asked employees of AIG Financial Products to step up and do the right thing Specifically  Ive asked those who received retention payments in excess of  100 000 or more to return at least half of those payments Some have already stepped forward  he said  and offered to give up a hundred percent of their payments Meanwhile  legislators have been scrambling to find ways to wiggle out of the retention contracts  with some threatening to pass legislation such that if the bonuses arent returned  they will be taxed to nothing In a letter to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner  Liddy vowed to do everything he could to reduce 2009 retention payments by at least 30 percent But he also warned that messing with commitments to employees could lead to a mass exodus that could threaten the companys ability to make taxpayers whole On the one hand  all of us at AIG recognize the environment in which we operate and the remonstrations of our president for a more restrained system of compensation for executives  Liddy said On the other hand  we cannot attract and retain the best and brightest talent to lead and staff the AIG businesses   which are now being operated principally on behalf of the American taxpayers   if employees believe that their compensation is subject to continued and arbitrary adjustment by the US Treasury Cummings isnt buying that In a statement provided to PolitiFact  Cummings said that while he understands where AIG is coming from in this argument  when I look at the bigger picture here  I just do not see this as being a reasonable argument for several reasons First  it is simply unnecessary to give a  4 million bonus to someone who is already making  1 million a year   we are talking about quadrupling an annual salary   to keep someone at a company when the job market is as weak as it is In these times  a weekly paycheck is all the retention payment anybody needs Second  AIG is losing employees anyway  despite offering these retention payments And  if you think about it  this makes sense What employee is going to stay with a company when the company announces that it is liquidating its assets? This company has suffered the greatest quarterly loss in the history of corporate record keeping in this country Third  I just do not believe that the company is implementing the retention program in the most efficient and effective manner I could possibly understand giving retention payments to a handful of top employees to keep them   but thousands of employees? I just cannot fathom how there can be thousands of indispensable employees right now  when there are hundreds of thousands of people in the financial sector who have lost their jobs David Schmidt  a consultant at executive pay firm James F Reda   Associates  said retention award programs are fairly common for companies that are in trouble That doesnt mean you cant be annoyed by it  he said But the bottom line  he said  is that if the government figures out a way not to pay the bonuses  it likely means a lot of these folks are just going to leave The reality  Schmidt said  is that many of these employees are in high demand This is a complex issue  and much of the detail about the retention bonuses has not yet been publicly revealed And its certainly debatable whether the company needs to be paying such large retention bonuses to so many employees But the fact we are checking here is whether AIG plans to spend  57 million on retention awards for people it expects to terminate in the future And the answer  according to the companys recent SEC filings  is yes We rule the statement True,4,0,1436,real

And does the Dalai Lama  winner  1989  know about this? First  a crash course in cruise missiles They include everything from the short range Chinese Eagle Strike missile to the US Tomahawk Land Attack missile  which has a range of 1 500 miles The Federation of American Scientists  an independent Washington based group created in 1945 to analyze national security issues related to science and technology  defines cruise missiles as an unmanned self propelled guided vehicle that sustains flight through aerodynamic lift for most of its flight path and whose primary mission is to place an ordnance or special payload on a target More simply put  cruise missiles  often fired from sea or air  are jet propelled  as opposed to rocket propelled missiles Rather than the arc of a rocket  they fly more like a plane to avoid radar At least 12 exporting countries    Great Britain  the United States  China  France  Germany  Israel  Italy  Japan  Norway  Russia  Sweden  and Taiwan    have developed them  according to the FAS website  and dozens of other countries have some variant in their arsenals They arent cheap  either    Tomahawks now cost about  11 million apiece  the Navy said recently Cruise missiles can trace their antecedents to the infamous German V 1  or buzz bomb  of World War II And some countries have had short range  anti ship cruise missiles for years John Pike  the director of GlobalSecurityorg  a Washington based website of military information  said the US relied on them as part of its nuclear arsenal for most of the Cold War and then began to deploy them as conventional weapons Pike said current day cruise missiles major debut came in 1991 during the Gulf War under President George HW Bush That campaign saw almost 300 Tomahawk cruise missiles fired An elite group Given the limited time frame that cruise missiles have been used  the number of Nobel laureates who could have fired them is limited For starters  Nobel laureates such as the International Campaign to Ban Landmines  1997   Burmese human rights activist Aung San Suu Kyi  1991  and Doctors Without Borders  1999  arent going to be firing cruise missiles    ever Similarly  while the United States fired them in Serbia as part of a NATO air campaign  they cant be attributed to 1991 Nobel laureate Kofi Annan  the secretary general of the United Nations  which had peacekeeping troops in the Balkans And former President Jimmy Carter  who won the prize in 2002  was not directly involved in any major hostilities while in office  outside of trying to rescue the American Embassy hostages in Iran Mikhail Gorbachev  Nobel  1990  was known for helping to end the Cold War and reducing the nuclear arsenal  but did preside over the Soviet Union during its final years in its invasion of Afghanistan Pike noted that western accounts of the Soviet war in Afghanistan are necessarily incomplete  but says he cannot imagine what type of cruise missile they would have used there And while the Israelis have also developed cruise missiles over the years  some reportedly for nuclear purposes  they have held them largely in check Accounts of the 1973 Yom Kippur War indicate that the Egyptians used about two dozen short range Soviet made anti ship cruise missiles against the Israelis  which would implicate then Egyptian President Anwar Sadat  who won the Nobel along with Israels Menachem Begin in 1978  And the Israelis reportedly fired anti ship Gabriel missiles at Egyptian and Syrian targets  sinking 10 of their boats But even if these were to be considered true cruise missiles  future Israeli prime ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres  who shared the prize with Yasser Arafat in 1994  were not in power at the time  nor was Begin And the numbers fall short of US salvos The Obama Tally So is Obama a cruise missile firing standout among Nobel laureates? He has fired at least 192  according to the Pentagons March 28 briefing about Libya  and is the fourth American president in a row to launch them But hes the only president in that group to win the peace prize Vice President Al Gore  who went on to win his Nobel in 2007 for his work on global warming  supported the American use of cruise missiles in the 1999 NATO effort to protect Kosovo And  in fact  as president  Bill Clinton deployed Tomahawks repeatedly  sending well over 600 cruise missiles during his administration at targets in Iraq  Serbia  Sudan and Afghanistan But  Clinton was commander in chief  not Gore Its also worth noting that the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize winner  former Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger  has been linked to the secret bombing of Cambodia during the Vietnam War But he and Richard Nixon used bombers  not nuclear tipped cruise missiles  for that campaign Experts said they believe the signs claim about Obama and cruise missiles appears technically true  but also merits some context George R Lucas Jr  the chairman in ethics at the Stockdale Center for Ethical Leadership at the US Naval Academy and a professor of ethics and public policy at the Naval Postgraduate School  said by e mail that the statement was probably true by definition and undoubtedly deliberately ironic to score a point My own sense is that this president  has  behaved very responsibly with the use of military force  but that  like all recent presidents  he has faced circumstances that are profoundly complex  and in which the decisions to use force are open to question and criticism  Lucas wrote For his part  Obama  in a March 28  2011  speech  defended the Libyan strikes  saying they were for a humanitarian purpose  intended to save the city of Benghazi and the people within Based on our review of historical records and interviews with military historians  it appears the sign along the New Hampshire highway is correct The next closest contender was Sadat during the Yom Kippur war  but it appears he was far short of the number fired by Obama  even in combination with other laureates If we hear of additional evidence  well revisit this item But in the meantime  the numbers indicate the sign is correct,3,0,1311,real

LaPierre responded  I think the National Instant Check System  the way its working now  is a failure Because this administration is not prosecuting the people that they catch Twenty three states are not even putting the mental records of those adjudicated mentally incompetent into the system Now  assume that if you dont prosecute  and they try to buy a gun  even if you catch them  and you let them walk away  to assume theyre not going to get a gun    theyre criminals  theyre homicidal maniacs  and theyre mentally ill I mean  we all know that homicidal maniacs  criminals and the insane  dont abide by the law The NRAs website on March 12  2013  posted its firm stance against expanding background checks  The NRA opposes criminalizing private firearms transfers between law abiding individuals  and therefore opposes an expansion of the background check system,1,0,682,real

Should they include instructions about using contraceptives? Or should it be Bushs policy  which is just abstinence? McCain   Long pause  Ahhh I think I support the presidents policy Q  So no contraception  no counseling on contraception Just abstinence Do you think contraceptives help stop the spread of HIV? McCain   Long pause  Youve stumped me Q  I mean  I think youd probably agree it probably does help stop it? McCain   Laughs  Are we on the Straight Talk Express? Im not informed enough on it Let me find out You know  Im sure Ive taken a position on it on the past I have to find out what my position was Brian  would you find out what my position is on contraception   Im sure Im opposed to government spending on it  Im sure I support the presidents policies on it Q  But you would agree that condoms do stop the spread of sexually transmitted diseases Would you say  No  were not going to distribute them  knowing that? McCain   Twelve second pause  Get me Coburns thing  ask Weaver to get me Coburns paper that he just gave me in the last couple of days Ive never gotten into these issues before So yes  McCain said he was stumped when asked whether he thinks contraceptives help stop the spread of HIV This is one truth telling condom,7,0,477,real

In short  yes  he did But it was in 1994 Running for Senate in Massachusetts  Romney criticized his opponent  Democrat Ted Kennedy  for supporting a crime bill in Congress Romney said Kennedy had worked to expand the cost of the bill while weakening several provisions According to a story in the Boston Globe about the issue  Romney stressed that he supported the bills ban on 19 different types of assault weapons    which the NRA opposed I dont line up with the NRA  Romney said  according to the story The quote was not a blanket statement of disagreement with the NRA  as Santorums ad could suggest Rather Romney was talking about a particular issue on which he didnt agree with the NRAs position At the time  Romney also voiced support for the Brady Bill  which imposed a five day waiting period on gun sales The NRA opposed that bill His words since In 2002  while running for governor  Romney was still talking the gun control talk In a debate comment captured in this Y ouTube video   Romney said  We do have tough gun laws in Massachusetts I support them I wont chip away at them I believe they help protect us and provide for our safety In fact  he expanded those protections in the state In 2004  Gov Romney signed a permanent ban on assault weapons such as the AK 47 and Uzi The NRA called the law ineffective and unnecessary By 2007  when he was making his first run for president  Romneys tone had begun to change The Globe reported on his shift in rhetoric  He now touts his work as governor to ease restrictions on gun owners He proudly describes himself as a member of the NRA    though his campaign wont say when he joined And Friday  at his campaigns request  top officials of the NRA and the National Shooting Sports Foundation led him around one of the countrys biggest gun shows Romney says he still backs the ban on assault weapons  but he wont say whether he stands by the Brady Bill And after the gun show tour  his campaign declined to say whether he would still describe himself as a supporter of tough gun laws The Globe later reported that Romney admitted to joining the NRA in August  2006  just months before announcing his presidential candidacy At the time his campaign touted his pro gun efforts as governor  including his signing of an NRA backed bill that reduced a testing requirement on certain pistol makers before they could sell guns in Massachusetts and his designation of May 7  2005  as The Right to Bear Arms Day in Massachusetts to honor the right of decent  law abiding citizens to own and use firearms in defense of their families  persons  and property and for all lawful purposes  including the common defense The best evidence we found on the matter comes from a 2007 interview Romney gave on Meet the Press Host Tim Russert confronted Romney with his quotes from 1994 and asked him to explain Romney said  My position on guns is the same position Ive had for a long  long time That position is that I dont line up a hundred percent with the NRA I dont see eye to eye with the NRA on every issue He said he still supported banning weapons that are unusually lethal but hedged on waiting periods He said the Brady Bill originally included a waiting period because the time was necessary for performing background checks Now that technology enables instant background checks  such waiting periods are unnecessary  he said Then he spoke a bit about Second Amendment rights We should not interfere with the right of law abiding citizens to own guns  either for their own personal protection or hunting or any other lawful purpose I support the work of the NRA  Im a member of the NRA But do we line up on every issue? No  we dont  he told Russert The 2012 campaign Romney didnt attend the NRAs national convention in 2011 in Pittsburgh and instead sent a videotaped message  He said nothing about gun rights He offered congratulations to the organization and its leaders for their work defending the Constitution and criticized political leaders who would expand the reach of government I believe in America I believe in free enterprise  he said Romneys campaign website has a section devoted to gun rights It does not mention the NRA or the Massachusetts ban on assault weapons he signed as governor Instead  it touts his work on behalf of gun owners  including extending the terms of gun licenses in Massachusetts and making replacement licenses free As president  Mitt will work to expand and enhance access and opportunities for Americans to hunt  shoot  and protect their families  homes and property  and he will fight the battle on all fronts to protect and promote the Second Amendment  the website says We contacted the NRA for this story but didnt hear back The group has not endorsed any primary candidate    which isnt unusual It didnt announce its backing of John McCain in the last election until October of 2008 But the group has made clear its goal is to defeat President Barack Obama Christopher Cox  the NRAs chief lobbyist told Fox Business Network anchor Lou Dobbs in February 2012 that any of these  Republican  candidates would be a lot better than this president  So we take any of them over this guy,2,0,1003,real
1185,2009-09-11T18:05:17-04:00,2009,wwwyoutubecom,John Boehner,As a candidate  President Obama declared that everyone deserves access to reproductive health care that includes abortion  and vowed that this right would be at the heart of his health care reform plan if elected president,To build opposition to the health care bill  Republicans have been saying it would expand coverage of abortion To back up that claim  House Republican Leader John Boehner sent a GOP Leader Alert that said President Barack Obama was doing that to fulfill a campaign promise During his quest for the presidency  now President Obama declared that everyone deserves access to reproductive health care that includes abortion  and vowed that this right would be at the heart of his health care reform plan if elected president  Boehner wrote in the Sept 10  2009  message Theres never been any question that Obama favors abortion rights On Jan 22  2008  for instance  Obama released a statement on the 35th anniversary of the Roe vs Wade decision that legalized abortion that said  Throughout my career  Ive been a consistent and strong supporter of reproductive justice  and have consistently had a 100 percent prochoice rating with Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro Choice America But he has been somewhat more coy  or perhaps strategically fuzzy  about exactly where he would draw the line on federal funding for abortion in his own health care plan His comments on abortion rights have often used the phrase reproductive care rather than abortion Well take a separate look at the three parts of Boehners sentence Did candidate Obama say that everyone deserves access to reproductive health care? Did he say that such issues are at the heart of his health care reform plan? And did his definition of reproductive health care include abortion? On the first and second questions  we think then candidate Obama did say something that closely matches what Boehner says he did In a July 17  2007  appearance before the Planned Parenthood Action Fund  Obama said the following  In my mind  reproductive care is essential care It is basic care  so it is at the center and at the heart of the plan that I propose Essentially what were doing is  were going to set up a public plan that all persons and all women can access if they dont have health insurance It will be a plan that will provide all essential services  including reproductive services  as well as mental health services and disease management services  because part of our interest is to make sure that were putting more money into preventive care  This one is not included in our Obameter database of promises  but well examine next week whether it should be  The words Obama used are slightly different from the ones cited by Boehner  but we think that to say reproductive care is essential means that everyone deserves to have it Meanwhile  inferring from Obamas language that its a right requires a slight leap  but its close enough that we wont quibble So the key to whether Boehner is right comes with the third question  Does Obamas definition of reproductive health care necessarily include abortion? On this question  the evidence is suggestive but not quite a slam dunk Abortion opponents rely on a few pieces of evidence to support the assertion that Obama believes reproductive health care includes abortion One is a story that ran in the Chicago Tribune on July 18  2007  the day after Obamas Planned Parenthood speech In it  Washington bureau reporter Mike Dorning wrote that when Obama was asked about his proposal for expanded access to health insurance  the candidate said it would cover reproductive health services Contacted afterward  an Obama spokesman said that included abortions Another source is a candidate questionnaire by RH Reality Check  which describes itself as an online community and publication serving individuals and organizations committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights Posted Dec 21  2007  the questionnaire was filled out by Sen Barack Obamas campaign staff The question thats most relevant to Boehners assertion is this one  Q  Does Sen Obama support the Hyde amendment  which bars the use of federal funds to pay for abortions ? Under what circumstances does he believe that Medicaid should cover abortions  all pregnancies  life  or health threatening pregnancies  pregnancies that are a result of rape or incest  extreme fetal malformation ? A  Obama does not support the Hyde amendment He believes that the federal government should not use its dollars to intrude on a poor womans decision whether to carry to term or to terminate her pregnancy and selectively withhold benefits because she seeks to exercise her right of reproductive choice in a manner the government disfavors Both of these comments suggest  fairly strongly  that Obama would include access to abortion in his health care plan   but they leave a degree of doubt While we are not aware of any pushback from the campaign once these two items were published  both statements were made by campaign staffers  not the candidate himself On his campaign Web site  Obama did not specifically address the federal funding issue In the womens issues section  the campaign said only that Barack Obama understands that abortion is a divisive issue  and respects those who disagree with him However  he has been a consistent champion of reproductive choice and will make preserving womens rights under Roe vs Wade a priority as president He opposes any constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Courts decision in that case Asked for any additional evidence to back up Boehners assertion that Obama was referring specifically to abortion  Douglas Johnson  legislative director for the National Right to Life Committee  told PolitiFact that Obama was speaking in terms of art that his Planned Parenthood audience would immediately grasp Reproductive health services is one of those conventions that all of the players understand It is not limited to abortion  but it always encompasses abortion It is like when a prolife candidate says  I support strong legal protection for the right to life of unborn children Everyone on all sides understands that this means he thinks abortion generally should not be legal  and no doubt he also supports fetal homicide laws    I suppose someone could argue that since he didnt specifically mention abortion  there is the theoretical possibility that he wants to keep abortion completely unrestricted and only wants to pass fetal homicide laws But that would be to ignore the lexicon that groups develop on these issues and the way they are understood in context So back to Boehners claim He said that candidate Obama declared that everyone deserves access to reproductive health care that includes abortion  and vowed that this right would be at the heart of his health care reform plan if elected president The record shows that Obama did indeed make those statements His message to the abortion rights group may have been deliberately fuzzy  but its clear what he meant   and it was confirmed by the campaign to the Tribune reporter,6,0,1126,real

President Joe Biden and US Rep Paul Ryan of Wisconsin challenged and chided each others proposals  particularly on the hot button issue of Medicare reform Ryan is the author of a House budget proposal that calls for substantial changes to the government health care program for seniors  including an eventual shift to premium support which beneficiaries could use to purchase private insurance Romney has embraced it as a means of introducing choice and competition into Medicare Democrats  including Biden and President Barack Obama  say it will end up costing seniors more In the Oct 11 debate   Ryan defended the plan as having bipartisan support  This is a plan thats bipartisan Its a plan I put together with a prominent Democrat senator from Oregon  said Ryan Theres not one Democrat who endorses it  Biden interjected Our partner is a Democrat from Oregon  Ryan answered amid some cross talk And he said he does no longer support  it   Biden insisted Medicare    complex  polarizing and highly political because of the huge voting bloc of seniors who cherish it    is center stage in the campaign We decided to check whos right about across aisle support for the Republican plan The Ryan budgets Ryan  the Republican House budget chairman  first unveiled a budget blueprint in early 2011 that would convert Medicare to the premium support model It also raised the programs eligibility age from 65 to 67  called for a repeal of Obamacare and reined in other spending to reduce the federal deficit It passed the House on April 15  2011  but the Democrat controlled Senate rejected it a month later Arguments over Medicare hit a fever pitch that year  with Democrats accusing Republicans of voting to  end Medicare  Then  in December  the hope of compromise peeked through the partisan clouds Ryan and Sen Ron Wyden  D Ore  joined together and offered a compromise on Medicare reform ideas Their ideas were contained in a white paper    never taking the form of legislation    and were branded as marrying the best proposals from each side The main difference from Ryans original plan  The new proposal left in place traditional Medicare for those who wanted it  while still offering premium support to buy private policies Theres a lot to work with here in terms of trying to find common ground  Wyden said at the time  according to the Washington Post This doesnt end Medicare as we know it People can go to bed knowing that traditional Medicare will be there for them for all time He said the plan presented the opportunity for progressives and conservatives to come together and address the real challenges of the federal entitlement program  rising health costs and an aging population Democrats were unequivocal in their criticism The White House returned to the old party line  saying the plan would end Medicare as we know it House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other House Democrats said it would essentially kill Medicare Republicans  who sensed a political opportunity in the defection of Wyden  offered more open minded reactions Newt Gingrich  who called Ryans original plan right wing social engineering  praised the Ryan Wyden deal as a major breakthrough Wyden  a senator since 1996  is known as policy driven and liberal minded  but also a true and rare compromiser He told the Oregonian newspaper in March 2012 that he was not being punished by Democratic leaders for partnering with Ryan  saying his biggest adversaries were special interests When you deal with a big issue where there are a lot of passions  you expect this  he said then I made the judgment that I couldnt just sit by and talk about business as usual for this program that  for me  has been sacred for three decades He also found himself fending off suggestions by Romney that he abetted the Republicans Medicare plan Wyden  according to the Oregonian  said hed never spoken to Romney He posted an explanation in the Huffington Post titled  Preserving the Medicare Guarantee  Why Ive Been Working with Paul Ryan  He used personal anecdotes to explain his motivation to fight for seniors and warned that serious reform was needed to preserve the guarantee to all Americans that they will have high quality health care as they get older In the meantime  Ryan unveiled his budget proposal for 2013  It contained many of the same hallmarks as its predecessor  reduced federal spending  repeal of Obamacare Only this one incorporated the Ryan Wyden plan for Medicare  with premium support and the traditional option Wyden said he was wary of the wider proposal  citing a lower limit for Medicares spending growth and a full repeal of the health care overhaul He also warned his Medicare white paper should not be used to anoint the whole Ryan budget as having bipartisan support Any person on the right who says that this is about cover    that person is hurting senior citizens  Wyden said in a March 20 story in Congressional Quarterly Today I say that explicitly because theyre making it tougher to get a bipartisan agreement in the future Partners no more If the spring of 2012 showed the Ryan Wyden romance fading  late summer was the break up On Aug 11  2012  Ryan was tapped as Romneys running mate  and within days  Romney was hailing his VP nominees Medicare plan as bipartisan    and naming Wyden Paul Ryan and Sen Wyden said  No  we need to restore  retain and protect Medicare   Romney said at a campaign stop in Virginia Thats what our party will do The Post wrote that Wyden was apparently displeased about his sudden prominence as a validator of the Republican ticket Gov Romney is talking nonsense  Wyden told reporters  according to the Post He explained in detail his two main objections to Romneys proposals in an interview with Ezra Klein   who writes the Posts Wonk Blog Repealing Obamacare  he said  would undo changes to Medicare that are necessary to transition to premium support Secondly  Romney has proposed turning Medicaid  the health care program for the poor and disabled  into a block grant to the states and rein in spending That change  Wyden said  would do enormous harm to those people whose protection was at the center of the white paper Romneys approach to Medicaid completely pulls the rug out from under the poorest and most vulnerable seniors  he said If any doubt remained following the vice presidential debate on Oct 11 about Wydens position on the Republican Medicare plan  Wyden addressed it the same night on his Facebook page  The Republican ticket knows that neither I  nor any other Democrat  would support these policies The Romney Ryan plan on Medicare is further proof that Mitt Romney is singularly unfit to end gridlock and bring bipartisan solutions to Washington  he wrote,0,0,1136,real

Sanders asked The insurance companies  the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system Sanders numbers are arresting and largely correct The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has the data for all three nations The following table has breakdown Do the math  and total US spending is about 27 times what they spend in the United Kingdom per person  and a bit over twice what they spend per person in France Everything is measured in dollars  and the data are from 2013 Its interesting to note the role that public spending makes in each country In the United States  public and private spending are nearly the same In the United Kingdom and France  private spending is a much smaller slice of the total Sanders claim in this case is more accurate than more sweeping versions he has made in the past In 2009 and again in 2015   he claimed that the United States spends twice as much per capita on health care as any other country Those claims are overly broad,1,0,296,real

We realized the recent outbreak of salmonella poisoning from peanut products exposed serious problems with food manufacturing and plant inspections But Rep Rosa DeLauro  a Connecticut Democrat  alleged it also exposed the federal Food and Drug Administration as toothless when it comes to recalls When the salmonella source was finally identified  FDA officials had to wait for industry approval before they could go live with the recall  the congresswoman said at a Feb 4  2009  news conference DeLauro was speaking amid great public concern about the outbreak  which was discovered in January 2009 after it killed eight people and sickened more than 500 in 43 states It was traced to tainted peanut butter and paste from a Peanut Corporation of America plant in Georgia and possibly another in Texas Those ingredients had been distributed nationwide in all sorts of products  prompting recalls of more than 2 100 products from energy bars to ice cream DeLauros comment evoked an image of FDA officials meekly asking company executives if it was okay to protect the public from tainted peanuts We wondered whether she was stretching the truth to drum up support for a bill she proposed to strengthen the FDAs recall process A spokeswoman said DeLauro was referring to the voluntary nature of food recalls And indeed  the FDA recall process is almost entirely voluntary   strictly speaking This is poorly understood by consumers  the media and even some food companies  the FDA says in this primer on its recall policies The Federal Food  Drug  and Cosmetic Act does not generally authorize FDA to order a manufacturer to recall a food  cosmetic or supplement  the online brochure says Only when it comes to medical devices  human tissue products and infant formula can the agency order a recall DeLauros office said she got her information partly from this New York Times article   which reported that the government needed the companys permission last week before announcing a huge recall of its products Theres an important bit of context to add  though In reality  companies do not generally refuse FDA requests to issue a recall In fact  none has ever done so  at least in the memory of Stephen Sundlof  director of the FDAs Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition I dont think theres ever been a case to my knowledge where a company has refused to recall products when we told them in very specific terms that we would be taking additional actions  Sundlof told a Senate committee in a Feb 5  2009  hearing on the salmonella outbreak Additional actions the FDA can take against any company that refuses to recall food can include seizing products and enjoining the company from doing further business Bill Marler  a personal injury lawyer who specializes in foodborne illnesses  concurred with Sundlof He said companies have little motivation to refuse the agencys recall requests  or even delay the process  because doing so would expose them to more legal liability In my experience  there is very seldom a delay  because most of the time youve got a company who wants to solve the problem and not poison any more of its customers than it already has  said Marler  who is based in Seattle Plenty of food safety advocates argue the FDA should have the authority to mandate recalls But their main concern is not that companies refuse to issue recalls voluntarily  its issues such as FDAs limited control over how aggressively to recover products  and that voluntary recalls might not sound serious enough to consumers DeLauro arguably made our food safety regime sound weaker than it is  since there is little question as a practical matter that companies will quickly agree to recalls And it was imprecise for her to say the FDA waited for the companys approval to go live with the recall   the FDA did not go live with the recall at all  it was the company that issued it But go live is a vague term  and DeLauro seems to have meant announce And its true that the FDA could not post on its Web site this press release announcing the recall  which came from the Peanut Corporation of America  until the company agreed to issue the recall and wrote the release So while DeLauros depiction of the recall process was not full and complete  it was technically accurate,1,0,731,real

with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election Barack Obama  fall 2007 Weve made the decision not to participate in the public financing system for the general election Barack Obama  June 19  2008 Sen Barack Obamas decision to opt out of the public financing system marked a milestone in modern presidential politics  the first time a major nominee has declined public financing since the system was created after Watergate Obamas announcement on June 19  2008  prompted swift criticism from Sen John McCains campaign that Obama had flip flopped The true test of a candidate for president is whether he will stand on principle and keep his word to the American people  said McCain communications director Jill Hazelbaker Barack Obama has failed that test today  and his reversal of his promise to participate in the public finance system undermines his call for a new type of politics The group Let Freedom Ring made a similar charge in July 2008 with a TV ad We explore the groups other claims in the ad in this story Here  well examine the allegation about public financing When we talk about public financing  were talking about candidates agreeing to skip private fundraising and instead run their campaigns using a pot of public money that comes from taxpayers who direct  3 to the fund on their tax returns The upside is that candidates dont have to spend time seeking contributions  but the downside is that their spending is limited to an amount set by the Federal Election Commission This years general election limit is  841 million per candidate  but the spending period is limited to the two months between the nominating conventions in late August and early September  and the Nov 4 election To explore whether Obama made a full flip flop  lets go back a year to 2007 shortly before he announced his candidacy On Feb 1  2007  Obama requested an opinion of the FEC on whether he could privately raise money for the general election but reserve the right to use public financing if he returned what he had raised A month later  the FEC issued an advisory opinion that said it was okay as long as his campaign kept the contributions separate The day of the FEC decision  McCains campaign said he would commit to public financing Should John McCain win the Republican nomination  we will agree to accept public financing in the general election  if the Democratic nominee agrees to do the same  Terry Nelson  McCains campaign manager  told the New York Times Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton responded by saying  If Senator Obama is the nominee  he will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election In the fall of 2007  Obama elaborated on his position when he answered a questionnaire sent by the Midwest Democracy Network  which asked the candidates if they would participate in public financing Yes  Obama said in his response In February 2007  I proposed a novel way to preserve the strength of the public financing system in the 2008 election My plan requires both major party candidates to agree on a fundraising truce  return excess money from donors  and stay within the public financing system for the general election  The Federal Election Commission ruled the proposal legal  and Sen John McCain has already pledged to accept this fundraising pledge If I am the Democratic nominee  I will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election The message seemed clear  Obama and McCain wanted a publicly funded general election But then both campaigns saw tactical advantages to getting out of the public financing system McCain filed a letter with the Federal Election Commission on Feb 6  2008  saying he wanted to withdraw from public funding for the primaries McCains private fundraising had improved after his early primary victories  and his strategists were concerned that they would be hamstrung by spending limits if they stayed in the public system But that effort stalled because of vacancies on the FEC Chairman David M Mason sent a letter to McCain on Feb 19  2008  saying he needs four members seated to make a ruling Obama repeated his commitment in a Feb 26  2008  debate in Cleveland  Ohio  when moderators pushed him to explain why voters shouldnt consider his position on public financing to have changed What Ive said is  at the point where Im the nominee  at the point where its appropriate  I will sit down with John McCain and make sure that we have a system that works for everybody In the meantime  Obamas campaign had benefited from an unprecedented tidal wave of private contributions  especially from donors who gave less than  200 The small contributions not only fueled the campaign in the early primaries  but the donors could be tapped again  and again  before they hit the  2 300 limit for individuals As they considered their plans for the general election  a factor for both campaigns was the money spent by independent groups known as 527s  named after the section of the tax code that governs them Groups on both sides were expected to spend tens of millions of dollars  but if those contributions were lopsided  a candidate who had accepted public financing could be at a disadvantage because of the spending limits So as the money flowed in  Obama campaign strategists made a calculation  They decided they could raise so much from private contributions that they were better off avoiding the private system Its not an easy decision  and especially because I support a robust system of public financing of elections  Obama said in a video to supporters But the public financing of presidential elections as it exists today is broken  and we face opponents whove become masters at gaming this broken system He said McCains campaign and the Republican National Committee are largely bankrolled by Washington lobbyists and special interest PACs And weve already seen that  McCain is  not going to stop the smears and attacks from his allies running so called 527 groups  who will spend millions and millions of dollars in unlimited donations Asked whether they pursued an agreement with McCain  the Obama campaign pointed us to a news account that said Bob Bauer  an attorney for Obama  met with McCain lawyers to discuss how both campaigns could operate in the public financing system But that account was sketchy and didnt sound to us like the aggressive pursuit that Obama had promised The fact is that Obama said he would pursue public financing  but decided it wasnt in the campaigns tactical interest,0,0,1117,real
1199,2009-09-21T16:18:56-04:00,2009,financesenategov,National Right to Life Committee,The Baucus bill contains provisions that would send massive federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and government chartered cooperatives that pay for elective abortion,With the recent release of the Senate Finance Committee plan for health care reform  the abortion issue has re emerged in the health care debate And both sides are choosing their words carefully to score political points We are examining two seemingly similar statements from the National Right to Life Committee that we think get to the heart of the rhetoric One is that under the bill proposed by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus  D Mont  federal funds  tax dollars  would subsidize abortions  and the other is that federal subsidies would go to insurance companies that offer abortion coverage They sound similar  but we ended up with rulings at opposite ends of our Truth O Meter We take a look at the first claim  that federal tax dollars would subsidize abortions  in a separate item and conclude the statement is False  In this item  we deal with a statement from NLRC legislative director Douglas Johnson that the Baucus bill contains provisions that would send massive federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and government chartered cooperatives that pay for elective abortion If you look carefully  the issue here is government involvement in plans that offer abortion And thats a big deal The 1976 Hyde Amendment prohibits the use of federal funds for  abortions through Medicaid except in cases of rape  incest or when the mothers  health is in peril So states that want to offer abortion coverage have to pay  for it themselves Similar restrictions on public funding for abortions applies  to federal health care coverage extended to active and retired military and  federal employees Baucus said he attempted to find language that just maintains the status quo on abortion  because he didnt want the issue to be a distraction This is a health care bill  not an abortion bill  Baucus said Maintaining the status quo  however  is a matter of perception And thats because there are two competing realities On the one hand  as President Barack Obama acknowledged in a July 21 interview  We  have a tradition of  in this town  historically  of not financing abortions as part of government funded health care In other words  the more than 250 private health plans that cover federal employees   because they are subsidized by the federal government   cannot offer full abortion services On the other hand  many private plans  outside the government  currently offer abortion services If the government starts providing health care subsidies but bans the participation of any plan that offers abortion services  as some legislators have suggested   abortion rights groups argue it would strip millions of women of benefits they currently get According to a 2002 Guttmacher Institute study  87 percent of  employment based insured health plans offered coverage for abortions  though not  all companies select it for their employees  A 2003 Kaiser Family Foundation  survey found that 46 percent of covered workers had coverage for abortions The  two surveys asked different questions  but the bottom line is that a significant  percentage of women have health insurance that covers abortions According to Baucus chairmans mark  which provides a blueprint for the plan  abortion cannot be a mandated as part of any minimum benefits package except in cases of rape  incest or if the mothers life is in danger However  health plans in the exchange or co op would not be prohibited from providing abortion coverage In fact  every state exchange would have to provide one plan that covers abortion and one that does not The exchange is a virtual marketplace where people can comparison shop for an insurance plan Baucus alternative to a public option  a co op  would be one alternative on the exchange  think of it as a credit union for health insurance  The plan provides federal dollars   through tax credits or cost sharing credits   to subsidize the cost of insurance for people with modest incomes So clearly  youd have federal subsidies going to plans that cover abortions But no more federal money would go to plans that offer abortion  so the added cost would presumably be passed on to consumers who choose plans that offer abortion  and efforts have been made to segregate funding so that only money from premiums   not tax dollars   would be used to pay for abortions But if millions of uninsured people would now get insurance due to the health care plan  and some of the plans offer abortion coverage  we think its fair to conclude the Baucus plan  or any other Democratic plan under consideration  would mean more women would have access to abortion services That obviously doesnt sit well with National Right to Life and other antiabortion groups Johnson said theyd like to see an amendment that would prohibit any insurer that gets federal subsidies from offering abortion services Amendments to that effect failed in the House The plan  as proposed  would lead to more abortion coverage  and therefore more abortions  Johnson said The Hyde Amendment  he said  is one of the most important abortion reduction policies adopted by Congress Not only cant the federal government subsidize abortion  he said  it cant subsidize plans that offer abortion The Baucus bill  he said  is a big departure from where we are now Heres Planned Parenthoods take on the Baucus plan  Planned Parenthood acknowledges that there are some compromises that need to be made to move health care reform forward  and we are willing to do so if it means more women can access affordable  quality health care from the provider of their choice While we are concerned that the language in the Senate Finance Bill specifically singles out abortion  we understand it is necessary to move health care reform forward As it currently stands  it is a carefully crafted compromise which assures that access to abortion would neither be mandated nor prohibited   and that women would not lose health care benefits that they have had for decades  while also addressing concerns that no federal funds would be used for abortion In the abortion debate  nothing is simple And as we said  words are chosen carefully Regarding Johnsons claim that the Baucus plan would result in federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and government chartered cooperatives that pay for elective abortion  we think he is on solid ground One could argue whether or not this is a departure from making the bill abortion neutral   each side has its take on that   but the fact is the plan would allow insurers to offer abortion And the plan includes federal subsidies to some who might choose to join such a plan And so we rule Johnsons statement True,0,0,1099,real

The requirement was for more work  not less At PolitiFact  we have examined this welfare controversy before  Here  well review the issue in light of Clintons new statement The HHS memo Since 1996  welfare has been administered through block grants to states The grant program  called Temporary Assistance to Needy Families  or TANF  limits how long families can get aid and requires recipients to eventually find a job It also includes stringent reporting requirements for states to show they are successfully moving people into the workforce A July 12  2012  memo from George Sheldon  acting assistant secretary at the US Department of Health and Human Services  HHS   said the department wanted to give states more flexibility in meeting those requirements The memo notifies states of the Secretarys willingness to exercise her waiver authority  to allow states to test alternative and innovative strategies  policies  and procedures that are designed to improve employment outcomes for needy families The memo outlined the kinds of waivers that would be considered It suggested projects that improve collaboration with the workforce and or post secondary education systems and demonstrate strategies for more effectively serving individuals with disabilities  to give two examples What does that mean? If you can do a better job connecting people to work  we would consider waiving certain parts of the performance measures and use alternate measures  is how Liz Schott  a senior fellow at the left leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities  translated the memos point  The center supports the plan  The waivers  then  would inject some flexibility For example  someone with a special needs child might require different work arrangements than are currently allowed Or a person who needs to improve his or her English skills might need more time to take classes Sebelius letter HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius reasserted the intent of the changes in a July 18 letter to Sen Orrin Hatch  R Utah The proposal we have outlined strengthens the laws purpose to move people off of welfare and into jobs by utilizing state based innovation Our goal is to accelerate job placement by moving more Americans from welfare to work  and no policy which undercuts that goal or waters down work requirements will be considered or approved by the Department  Sebelius wrote She noted how  in 2005  several governors sought such flexibility in welfare and state waiver authority That letter was signed by 29 Republican governors  including Mitt Romney of Massachusetts Now  some states are again asking for flexibility  Sebelius wrote  naming Utah and Nevada  which both currently have Republican governors She said some of the policies they requested would not meet the new HHS requirements The department is providing a very limited waiver opportunity for states that develop a plan to measurably increase the number of beneficiaries who find and hold down a job Specifically  governors must commit that their proposals will move at least 20 percent more people from welfare to work compared to the states past performance  Sebelius wrote States must also demonstrate clear progress toward that goal no later than one year after their programs take effect If they fail  their waiver will be rescinded Because no waivers have yet been approved  its difficult to say exactly what the changes would look like The policy debate Its important to note that the waivers would not just be a change on paper Schott said its possible that waivers will allow states to get credit under the work requirement for activities that dont count currently Schott offered the hypothetical scenario that a state might change some requirements for specific subgroups  such as two parent families  possibly by letting them stay in school longer A waiver would let the state count those parents toward its work participation requirement That is credit a state doesnt get now and that could be counted toward a 20 percent improvement That broader definition has some critics concerned Robert Rector  a welfare expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation  said it could ultimately allow state bureaucrats to count activities that arent really work In the past  state bureaucrats have attempted to define activities such as hula dancing  attending Weight Watchers  and bed rest aswork These dodges were blocked by the federal work standards Now that the Obama administration has abolished those standards  we can expectwork in the TANF program to mean anything but work  Rector argued He also wrote   following Clintons speech  that the 20 percent increase Sebelius is demanding is a meaningless measure because in a typical state 15 percent of welfare recipients leave the program for work every month To increase that by 20 percent would be a bump to only 18 percent of recipients gaining employment What will the other 982 percent of the caseload be doing? No one knows for sure But one thing we do know for certain  They will be exempt from the federalwork participation requirements established in the welfare reform law  Rector wrote Schott counters that the 20 percent improvement measure doesnt exempt anyone from working Nothing about the waiver lifts the work requirement on any individual The waiver is about the states performance measurement  she said The federal work participation requirement is something that states must meet  Nobody is suggesting waiving that Rector also contends that Sebelius is not legally authorized to issue waivers of existing work requirements He argues that the part of the law allowing waivers does not cover TANF work provisions Critically  this section  as well as most other TANF requirements  is deliberately not listed its provisions cannot be waived  Rector wrote in a July 12 column in the National Review His argument on that point got an important affirmation this week when the Government Accountability Office said that Sebelius waiver proposal is subject to the requirement that it be submitted to both Houses of Congress and the Comptroller General before it can take effect The Obama administration did not ask for Congress approval to grant waivers,3,0,1179,real

They are remarkably high A May 2007 poll taken by Ivan Moore Research in Alaska put Palins positive rating at 89 percent Thats off the charts high But Moores survey wasnt a traditional approval rating or job performance measure Rather  respondents were asked to rate their feelings toward public figures as very or somewhat positive or very or somewhat negative The verys and somewhats were then combined A poll two weeks before that one  from Dittman Research  gave Palin a 93 percent approval rating The Moore poll numbers hit a low of 76 percent in mid July   in the midst of Troopergate coverage   but bounced back to 80 percent in mid August That mirrored a Hays Research Group poll on July 24 and 25 in which 80 percent rated Palins performance as somewhat or very favorable Moore hasnt polled similar questions in other states  so he wouldnt say categorically that Palins are the highest in the country But it doesnt take a rocket scientist to know 89 percent is going to be at the top of the list  Moore said On Sept 3  the McCain campaign released results of an American Viewpoint poll on Sept 2   after the announcement of Palin as McCains running mate   that found Palin had an 86 percent overall job approval rating That was a poll commissioned by the McCain campaign  so take that for what its worth Again  these are extraordinarily high numbers by any measure But according to Rasmussen polls  Palin gave up her crown as most popular in July  overtaken by North Dakotas Gov John Hoeven A Rasmussen poll on July 30 found 64  of voters rate Palins job performance as excellent or good versus 14  who view it as poor On July 8  Hoeven clocked 72 percent at excellent or good against just 6 percent who rated his performance as poor Scott Rasmussen  founder and CEO of Rasmussen Reports  said people shouldnt get hung up on whether someone ranked No 1 or 2 Those numbers change with the political winds of the day In a broader sense  she  Palin  is one of the very top  Rasmussen said The polling firm SurveyUSA has in the past conducted governors approval ratings in all 50 states  but not since Palin took office In 2006  the highest ratings were around 80 percent The ratings being reported in Alaska for Palin are extraordinarily high  said Jay Leve  editor of SurveyUSA Those kinds of numbers are unprecedented And based on the previous highs for approval ratings  he said  its highly likely Palin is now top dog Jennifer Duffy  a senior editor for The Cook Political Report  and John McIntyre  managing editor at Real Clear Politics   two groups that pay close attention to such things   also believe Palins numbers rank her as the most popular Its difficult to make a categorical statement like that  McIntyre said But generally  they are on pretty solid ground If I was a betting person  I bet thats an accurate statement Once your approval rating is over 80 percent  its a little silly Bottom line  most experts say the McCain campaign is probably right,1,0,767,real

Catholic Church the Antichrist and a false cult,Note to readers  An update was posted to this item on May 23  2008  to reflect new information See note at the end of this story In an e mail to supporters  the liberal group MoveOnorg listed reasons people should not support Sen John McCain for president McCain has sought closer ties to the extreme religious right in recent years  the e mail said McCain sought the political support of right wing preacher John Hagee  who believes Hurricane Katrina was Gods punishment for gay rights and called the Catholic Church the Antichrist and a false cult Some of MoveOns points are correct McCain has accepted an endorsement from Hagee  an evangelical minister with a national following Since MoveOns e mail went out  however  Hagee has renounced his previous controversial statements Hagee heads the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio  Texas  with 17 000 members He has a nationally syndicated television show  John Hagee Today  a sprawling Web site and numerous books His dominant issue is the defense of Israel  He founded the advocacy group Christians United for Israel in 2006  and his book Jerusalem Countdown takes grim satisfaction in predicting a nuclear confrontation in the Middle East with the United States and Israel on one side and Iran on the other Hagees endorsement of McCain on Feb 27  2008  set off several rounds of controversy The day after the endorsement  the Catholic League called Hagee an anti Catholic bigot and lamented McCains connection to him The Catholic League monitors anti Catholic bias and emphasizes Catholic teaching on abortion and other moral issues It pointed to a video of Hagee in which Hagee discusses the Book of Revelation and the Catholic Church Hagee clearly uses the words Antichrist and false cult as he discusses the Catholic Church  the Crusades and the Holocaust  His statements are a little confusing  watch the video here  Hagee said he was only criticizing historical acts of anti Semitism by the Catholic Church  not expressing anti Catholic hatred But Catholic League president Bill Donahue said Hagees excuses werent credible and continued calls for McCain to distance himself During an interview with George Stephanopoulos on April 20  McCain said he still welcomed Hagees endorsement but strongly condemned any comments that he made about the Catholic church The Catholic League was satisfied with McCains comments but continued to criticize Hagee On May 13  Hagee released a letter sent directly to Donahue in which Hagee expressed regret for his previous statements about the Catholic Church Donahue accepted the apology The tone of Hagees letter is sincere  Donahue said in a statement He wants reconciliation and he has achieved it Indeed  the Catholic League welcomes his apology While the back and forth was going on about the Catholic Church  Hagee also retracted his previous comments about Hurricane Katrina Hagee had said in an interview on Sept 16  2006  The newspaper carried the story in our local area that was not carried nationally that there was to be a homosexual parade on the Monday that the Katrina came  and the promise of that parade was that it was going to reach a level of sexuality never demonstrated before in any of the other Gay Pride parades So I believe that the judgment of God is a very real thing I know that there are people who demure from that  but I believe that the Bible teaches that when you violate the law of God  that God brings punishment sometimes before the day of judgment  and I believe that the Hurricane Katrina was  in fact  the judgment of God against the city of New Orleans A publicist for Hagee sent us this statement dated April 25  2008  As a believing Christian  I see the hand of God in everything that happens here on earth  both the blessings and the curses But ultimately neither I nor any other person can know the mind of God concerning Hurricane Katrina I should not have suggested otherwise Hagees modest backtracking isnt that surprising  said John C Green  a senior fellow in religion and politics at the Pew Forum on Religion   Public Life  a nonpartisan research group that does not take positions in policy debates Hard charging rhetoric against the Catholic Church and other religions such as Judaism or Islam used to be more common among evangelical leaders  but its now falling out of favor  Green said Most evangelicals today dont use that kind of harsh language  because theyve discovered it has negative effects  Green said Its hard to make converts when you use that harsh language with them  and theyve also realized its not appropriate Of course  we cant definitively rule on whether Hagees new statements represent a true change of heart or just a political repositioning MoveOns attack was true when the group sent out the e mail  it was only later that Hagee retracted his comments UPDATE  On May 22  2008  McCain rejected the pastors endorsement  after audio of Hagee preaching  reportedly during the 1990s  was posted to the Internet In the recording  Hagee implied that Hilter and the Holocaust were part of Gods plan to create the state of Israel  Listen to the audio here   McCain said Hagees comments were deeply offensive and indefensible  and I did not know of them before Reverend Hagees endorsement  and I feel I must reject his endorsement as well Hagee  meanwhile  issued a statement saying that he was withdrawing his endorsement and that critics were distorting his views I am tired of these baseless attacks and fear that they have become a distraction in what should be a national debate about important issues  Hagee said on May 22  2008 I have therefore decided to withdraw my endorsement of Sen McCain for president effective today  and to remove myself from any active role in the 2008 campaign,0,0,967,real

Obama downplayed the relationship This is a guy who lives in my neighborhood  whos a professor of English in Chicago who I know and who I have not received some official endorsement from  Obama said Hes not somebody who I exchange ideas from on a regular basis And the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago  when I was 8 years old  somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make much sense  George Sen Hillary Clinton then piled on I also believe that Senator Obama served on a board with Mr Ayers for a period of time  the Woods Foundation  which was a paid directorship position And  if Im not mistaken  that relationship with Mr Ayers on this board continued after 9 11 and after his reported comments  which were deeply hurtful to people in New York and  I would hope  to every American  because they were published on 9 11  and he said that he was just sorry they hadnt done more We need to point out that it was merely a coincidence the remarks were published in the New York Times on Sept 11 and they had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks that day They were referring to activities by the Weather Underground in the 1970s Deborah Harrington  president of the Woods Fund  a philanthropic organization in Chicago  said Obama was a director from 1994 through 2001 That overlaps Ayers time as a director by three years It also means Obama served with Ayers for the final months of 2001  after Ayers made his comments to the New York Times Ayers  now a professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago  not English as Obama stated   is still on the seven member Woods Fund board In 2001  Ayers wrote a book  Fugitive Days   he called it a memoir   in which he wrote that he participated in the bombings of New York City police headquarters  the Capitol building and the Pentagon But in a review of the book  the New York Times noted that Ayers coyly noted that some of the book was fiction Last week  Ayers defended the September 2001 comments on his blog stating  Im sometimes asked if I regret anything I did to oppose the war in Vietnam and I say  No  I dont regret anything I did to stop the slaughter of millions of human beings by my own government Obama has minimized his relationship with Ayers Campaign finance reports show Ayers donated  200 to Obamas re election campaign in 2001 In the spirit of fairness  we should note that just before leaving office  President Bill Clinton pardoned Susan L Rosenberg who  according to a New York Times story in 2001  was a onetime member of the Weather Underground terrorist group who was charged in the notorious 1981 Brinks robbery in Rockland County that left a guard and two police officers dead,1,0,675,real
581,2008-07-22T00:00:00-04:00,2008,wwwjohnmccaincom,Barack Obama,McCain has switched to Obamas position on more troops to Afghanistan,Sen John McCain has praised the surge in Iraq for bringing greater stability to the region  and has reminded voters that he long supported it But while Iraq was stabilizing  the situation in Afghanistan was deteriorating So on July 15  2008  the McCain campaign released a new comprehensive strategy for victory in Afghanistan that applies the tried and true principles of counterinsurgency used in the Iraq surge His new policy includes sending at least three additional brigades to Afghanistan Our commanders on the ground say they need these troops  and thanks to the success of the surge  these forces are becoming available  states the campaigns strategy outline Sen Barack Obamas campaign pounced on this news By the end of the week  spokesman Bill Burton had sent out a memo titled  Obama leading on foreign policy  McCain following This past week  Senator McCain changed his position for political reasons  embracing Obamas call for more troops the day after Obama restated it in a New York Times op ed  and almost one year after Obamas initial plan  Burton wrote We reviewed the candidates past statements to determine whether McCain has changed position to match Obama Back on Aug 1  2007  Obama gave a major foreign policy speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington  DC The speech got a lot of attention because Obama said that the United States should aggressively pursue terrorists hiding in the mountains of Pakistan If we have actionable intelligence about high value terrorist targets and President Musharraf wont act  we will  Obama said  See our previous Truth O Meter rulings here   here and here   But Obama also talked about the need for the United States to turn its attention to Afghanistan Our troops have fought valiantly there  but Iraq has deprived them of the support they need   and deserve  Obama said As a result  parts of Afghanistan are falling into the hands of the Taliban  and a mix of terrorism  drugs and corruption threatens to overwhelm the country As president  I would deploy at least two additional brigades to Afghanistan to re enforce our counterterrorism operations and support NATOs efforts against the Taliban In the months that followed  Obama repeatedly emphasized his assertion that the United States had taken our eye off the ball by invading Iraq instead of concentrating on Afghanistan McCain  meanwhile  has rebutted Obama by saying that Iraq is and should be the central front on the war on terror We couldnt find examples of McCain specifically rejecting Obamas proposal to send more troops to Afghanistan Neither could we find examples of him supporting more brigades in Afghanistan  which likely would raise logistical questions about whether there were enough troops for a surge in both Iraq and Afghanistan Rather  when it came to Afghanistan  McCain emphasized the need for NATO countries to do their part  and for the United States and NATO forces to better manage troop levels and logistics As recently as July 8  2008  McCain emphasized these points During an interview with the Pittsburgh Tribune Review  McCain talked at length about NATO  saying only that it was possible the United States might have to add more troops  but not specifically endorsing that position Heres the exchange  Question  Senator  you had called the situation in Afghanistan tough and you said that any failure there could lead   could have dire consequences for the NATO alliance Beyond Pakistan  what do you think it takes for the US to succeed there? Is more troops the answer? McCain  I think there is a whole lot of challenges that we face One of them is whether we succeed or not in Iraq I think that has a direct impact on the region But I also believe that the Karzai government being more effective  the Pakistan situation as you and I discussed  the economic progress  again this is one of these situations where youve got to maintain the security environment  but then youve got to have the progress where people will have a better life to look forward to And one of the failures  because of corruption  has been that we havent made the progress economically in some of these parts of Iraq and we had this window of opportunity and it wasnt as well used as perhaps it could have But again  I cant tell you that theres one solution to it with the struggle military  diplomatic  intelligence  economic  its all of one and yet it has various aspects And I just finally would say  and Im sorry for some wrong answers  but we are in this with other nations Thats important And Im glad that Sarkozy is sending additional French troops over there Im glad that many of our allies  I wish more of them and I wish the rules of engagement for some of them were better and a lot of things But the fact is this is a   this is a lot of nations that are in this in a common interest Question  Do you think more troops should   do you think   some of the military have called for more additional troops  McCain  I think yes  and Id love to see our allies to contribute more in a broad variety of ways Id love to see that And we may have to send additional troops As you know  they just extended the Marine unit there by an additional 30 days And I think they had   they did that very reluctantly A week later  McCain would specifically advocate sending three more brigades to Afghanistan One point McCain has made again and again on the campaign trail is that  when it comes to foreign policy  he bases his opinions on conditions on the ground His new policy on Afghanistan can fairly be interpreted as a reaction to those conditions  which have demonstrably worsened in the weeks before his announcement The Obama campaign has said that McCain has changed position on Afghanistan for political reasons  to follow Obama We are not ruling on McCains motivation here  the McCain campaign can just as easily argue that McCain has changed position because circumstances have changed From a political standpoint  its certainly inconvenient when conditions on the ground dictate you dropping your position for your opponents Be all that as it may  Obama advocated more troops for Afghanistan about a year ago McCain only recently embraced the same position We rule this claim is True,2,0,1067,real

So we were surprised to hear the chair of President Obamas Council of Economic Advisers  Christina Romer  claim that experts are saying the economy will start to recover later this year We suspected her claim  at the very least  lacked a bit of context Which it does She made it on the March 15 Meet the Press   after host David Gregory played a recent tape of her saying most people are predicting positive growth in the economy some time in the second half of the year Romer  whom Obama recruited from the University of California Berkeley  stood by that I should say my prediction is very much what most private forecasters are saying  she said We know that this last week the Blue Chip Economic Indicators came out that surveys lots of private forecasters Almost all of them are predicting a turnaround in the third quarter and positive growth in the fourth quarter Blue Chip Economic Indicators is a monthly newsletter by specialty publisher Wolters Kluwer Law   Business It claims to survey Americas leading business economists and compiles their economic forecasts It serves a blue chip audience  A one year subscription costs  875 The consensus  or average prediction of the panelists  was that the economy as measured by the gross domestic product would grow 05 percent in the third quarter of 2009 and 18 percent in the fourth quarter That was not quite enough information to gauge the accuracy of Romers claim  so we asked editor Randell Moore for more detail He said 50 economists were surveyed  with 30 predicting positive growth in the third quarter of 2009 and 45 predicting positive growth in the fourth quarter That does indeed support Romers claim  since 45 out of 50 constitutes almost all the forecasters Some context is in order  though The 19 page report was hardly rosy In fact  it was more pessimistic than the previous months issue The issues summary was titled  The Longest  Deepest Recession Since World War II and it said  The economy still is expected to emerge from recession by the end of this year but consensus forecasts of economic growth in 2010 slipped lower once again this month The forecasters predicted that for 2009 as a whole  the economy is expected to shrink 26 percent  the largest annual contraction since the Great Depression That was worse than the prior months prediction of 19 percent There were some glimmers of hope in there  but they came amid glum news  as in this sentence  They say its always darkest before the dawn Well  this week bordered on a full scale blackout Also  we should add a general note of caution about the reliability of the newsletter The economists surveyed work for companies such as JPMorgan Chase  General Motors Corp  Morgan Stanley  Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Fannie Mae  all of which have decidedly less than sterling track records of late As a New York Times writer noted in January   these professional forecasters are typically employed by investment banks  trade associations and big corporations They base their forecasts on computer models that tend to see the American economy as basically sound  even in the worst of times The New York Times article added  They did not see a recession until late summer One reason they were blindsided  Their computer models do not easily account for emotional factors like the shock from the credit crisis and falling housing prices that have so hindered borrowing and spending Very few economists predicted the current economic crisis One who did  New York University professor and noted pessimist Nouriel Roubini  who is not a Blue Chip panelist   said on March 9 that he saw no hope for the recession ending in 2009 and  it  will more than likely last into 2010 But Romer is entitled to highlight optimistic forecasts And its true that almost all the panelists surveyed in Blue Chip Economic Indicators predicted a rebound by the fourth quarter of 2009,1,0,668,real

He fleshed out his views in a speech at a NATO security policy conference in Munich on Feb 2  2002 Terrorist training camps exist on Iraqi soil  and Iraqi officials are known to have had a number of contacts with al Qaida These were probably not courtesy calls  he said Americans have internalized the mantra that Afghanistan represents only the first front in our global war on terror The next front is apparent  and we should not shrink from acknowledging it A terrorist resides in Baghdad  with the resources of an entire state at his disposal  flush with cash from illicit oil revenues and proud of a decade long record of defying the international communitys demands that he come clean on his programs to develop weapons of mass destruction We should note that McCain suggested on several occasions that he would prefer alternatives to full on invasion and occupation as a means of displacing Saddam Hussein  such as on Meet the Press on July 14  2002  I have always strongly felt that you must try the option of opposition from within   arming  training  equipping and helping oppositions from within  the Kurds in the North  the Shiites in the South  McCain told the late Tim Russert At least try that option before we send Americans into harms way But two days later on Face the Nation  he made clear that if it took war to remove Hussein  he was all for it Look  we need a regime change in Iraq  he said If we can do it on the cheap by having operations involving just Special Forces and some air power and opponents within  either the Kurds in the south  Shiites in the north  sic   then thats fine But we have to be prepared to do whatever is necessary to bring about this regime change I think we also ought to prepare the American public in   in   by way of informing them that Saddam Hussein has these weapons  continues to attempt to improve the   their capability and would not be reluctant to export them to other countries He continued  So we need to keep telling the American people that as well  as well as basically   if I may be so blunt   frightening them   frightening and scaring them every day In early 2003  with calls for invasion of Iraq growing more insistent  McCains was among the most fervent voices Sept 11  2001 showed that al Qaida is a grave threat  he wrote in a Feb 14  2003 opinion piece in USA Today Saddam Hussein has the ability to make a far worse day of infamy by turning Iraq into a weapons assembly line for al Qaidas network  Saddam is an international felon who has repeatedly violated the terms of his parole and is planning further crimes with his terrorist accomplices He must be brought to justice once and for all The record clearly supports the contention that McCain was already turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9 11   indeed he singled out Iraq on Letterman   and became a leading supporter of the war  as Obama said,0,1,928,real
495,2008-05-21T00:00:00-04:00,2008,wwwcnncom,John McCain,Sen Obama has declared  and repeatedly reaffirmed his intention to meet the president of Iran without any preconditions,The issue of whether or not to meet diplomatically with the leaders of enemy nations is clearly shaping into an important wedge issue in the presidential campaign Sen John McCain has hammered Sen Barack Obama for saying he would meet with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  who is well known for his anti America  anti Israel rhetoric Sen Obama has declared  and repeatedly reaffirmed his intention to meet the president of Iran without any preconditions  likening it to meetings between former American presidents and the leaders of the Soviet Union  McCain said in remarks before the National Restaurant Association in Chicago on May 19  2008 McCain argues this position betrays the depth of Sen Obamas inexperience and reckless judgment While McCain has criticized Obamas approach of meeting with leaders of isolated nations in general  McCain has particularly singled out Ahmadinejad What does he  Obama  want to talk about with Ahmadinejad  who said that Israel is a stinking corpse? McCain asked Who said that he wants to wipe Israel off the map  who is sending the most explosive devices into Iraq killing Americans What does he want to talk about? Perhaps sensing political vulnerability on the issue  McCains campaign fired off a number of press releases accusing the Obama campaign of trying to back off Obamas stated position When asked in an interview with CNNs Wolf Blitzer how Obama could defend meeting without preconditions with Ahmadinejad  Obamas senior foreign policy adviser  Susan Rice  said Obama had promised only that hed meet with the appropriate Iranian leadership not necessarily Ahmadinejad More fuel was added to the debate when Joe Klein of Time magazine wrote in his blog that he could find no instance where Obama said he would negotiate specifically  by name  with Ahmadinejad He  Obama  did say that he would negotiate with the Iranian leadership    but  on matters of foreign policy and Irans nuclear program  the guy in charge is the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei  Klein noted Why doesnt the McCain campaign and other assorted Republicans ever accuse Obama of wanting to negotiate with Khamenei? Well  because Khamenei isnt quite the flagrant anti Semite Ahmadinejad is  and  as we keep hearing  Obama has a Jewish problem To be sure  when Obama raises this issue    which he does often on the stump    he usually says  generically  that he will meet diplomatically with the leaders of Americas enemies For example  when asked in a press conference in Watertown  SD  on May 16  2008  about the McCain campaign accusing him of trying to distance himself from comments about meeting with the leaders of rogue nations  Obama said he hasnt distanced himself at all I say that in every town hall meeting that we have and every rally  Obama said What I have said is that I will meet with not just our allies and our friends but I will initiate tough diplomacy with our enemies That includes Syria  Iran  North Korea and Venezuela I would meet with them and I would meet with them without preconditions although with preparation I would present to them very clearly what my expectations would be in terms of them changing their behavior If it was in the case of Iran  stop threatening Israel  stand down on nuclear weapons development  stop funding Hamas and Hezbollah and stop stirring up problems inside of Iraq If they are willing to change behavior  then  we would offer inducements and benefits diplomatically If they dont  we will continue to ratchet sanctions and isolations on Iran That has been a consistent policy that I have presented throughout There are no contradictions I have no idea where it is that they are suggesting that somehow there has been a change in policy But has Obama said specifically that hed meet with Ahmadinejad? We could find no public statements where Obama neatly says  I will meet with Ahmadinejad But we believe there are some instances where that was the substance of Obamas words One example came in a press conference in New York City on Sept 24  2007 Question  Senator  youve said before that youd meet with President Ahmadinejad  Would you still meet with him today? Nothings changed with respect to my belief that strong countries and strong presidents talk to their enemies and talk to their adversaries  Obama responded I find many of President Ahmadinejads statements odious and Ive said that repeatedly And I think that we have to recognize that there are a lot of rogue nations in the world that dont have American interests at heart But what I also believe is that  as John F Kennedy said  we should never negotiate out of fear but we should never fear to negotiate And by us listening to the views even of those who we violently disagree with   that sends a signal to the world that we are going to turn the page on the failed diplomacy that the Bush Administration has practiced for so long The McCain campaign provided snippets of news accounts of that press conference that left little doubt how the press interpreted Obamas comments at the time Check out these headlines  Obama Stood His Ground Monday On His Controversial Remarks Earlier This Year That He Would Meet With Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  from CNN   and Obama  I Would Still Meet With Ahmadinejad  from CBS News  In a Nov 11  2007  interview on NBCs Meet the Press  Obama again mentioned Ahmadinejad when discussing his open door policy Part of the reason its important for us to talk to countries we dont like and leaders we dont like  its not that I think that in a conversation with somebody like Ahmadinejad that Im going to somehow change his mind on everything  but what we do is  we send a signal to other leadership in Iran  to the Iranian people and to the world community that we are listening and that we are willing to try to resolve conflicts peacefully Host Tim Russert asked if Obama was afraid of being used in a propaganda way Ive got to say Im not afraid of losing a propaganda war to somebody like Ahmadinejad  Obama said You know  strong countries and strong presidents speak with their adversaries In those contexts  Obama clearly counts Ahmadinejad among those with whom he would meet,5,0,1044,real

Thats the refrain these days on where the former Florida governor stands on creating a process for people in the US illegally to eventually become American citizens    or something secondary to that  such as legal residents Since his new book Immigration Wars was released this week  Bush has been accused of changing position   JebBush a flip flop flip on immigration? Wow I fashioned you more of a baseball player than a gymnast My bad  notsurprisedatall   Florida Democratic Rep Debbie Wasserman Schultz quipped in a tweet on March 5  2013 Bush  60  has enjoyed distinction as an elder statesman in the Republican party since leaving elected office in 2007 But with the release of his book  Bush has indicated hes considering a future presidential run  Im not saying yes  Im just not saying no  he told MSNBC  We found that Bush  now a definite maybe for 2016  has indeed said conflicting things over time about eventual citizenship for illegal immigrants  Start deporting people Bush  a Texas native who calls Florida his adopted home state  plunged into politics in 1994 with a run to unseat Democratic Gov Lawton Chiles Back then  there was virtually no talk of turning millions of illegal immigrants in the US into citizens When asked what to do with them  Bush had one word  deportation In an interview with the Miami Herald  he was asked  There are something like 4 million illegals in the United States     What would you do with the ones that are here? Start deporting people  he answered We have an asylum process     It shouldnt take five years We need to reform our system  I dont blame them for wanting to come to our country  but I dont believe its necessarily our responsibility to allow them to come in But he also made it clear he was not in favor of closing the border I believe in open  legal immigration  Bush said He lost that election  but stormed back four years later and won the governors race By 2006  Bush was well established as Floridas chief executive  and he wasnt afraid to criticize members of his own party His views  it seems  had evolved beyond start deporting people In an email exchange with the Los Angeles Times that year  Bush weighed in with support for proposed federal immigration reform legislation  calling it just plain wrong to charge illegal immigrants with a felony and opposed penalizing the children of illegal immigrants by denying them US citizenship He endorsed the idea of a broad guest worker program  but the Los Angeles Times noted then that he offered no specificity on how to treat current immigrants and whether they should be granted a path to citizenship In 2009  Bush co chaired a bipartisan task force for the Council on Foreign Relations  which studied immigration challenges and came up with a set of proposals In an interview about the groups recommendations  Bush said that if reform doesnt happen  we ignore an issue that needs to be solved  which is what do we do with people who are here permanently  who have made contributions  who if given a path to citizenship would do whats right and take the necessary steps to achieve legalized status and citizenship However  in a separate op ed about the task force recommendations  Bush simply said reform should include a fair and orderly way to allow many of those currently living here illegally to earn the right to remain legally 2012  Bush stakes his position Last year  Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney declared that he would pursue an immigration policy so austere that illegal immigrants would self deport    a position later faulted for Republicans poor showing among Hispanic voters Bush  meanwhile  continued his call for more welcoming rhetoric and a broader approach to legislation that dealt with issues beyond border security and cracking down on illegal migration In an interview last summer with Charlie Rose  he made a clear declaration that he favored citizenship You have to deal with this issue You cant ignore it And so  either a path to citizenship  which I would support and that does put me probably out of the mainstream of most conservatives  Or a path to legalization  a path to residency of some kind  he said Fast forward past the election Its now 2013  and Republicans are smarting from their losses and pledging to remake their platform into one that appeals more to Hispanics and other minorities A bipartisan group of Senators is working on reform legislation that includes citizenship But Bushs book  which reportedly went to the printer in late 2012  split the concepts of citizenship and legal residency And in print  Bush opposed citizenship and instead proposed a path to permanent legal resident status Permanent residency in this context  however  should not lead to citizenship It is absolutely vital to the integrity of our immigration system that actions have consequences   in this case  that those who violated the laws can remain but cannot obtain the cherished fruits of citizenship  A grant of citizenship is an undeserving reward for conduct that we cannot afford to encourage Illegal immigrants  he and co author Clint Bolick wrote  could return to their homeland and apply for citizenship through regular channels After immediately catching heat over the book    and how it conflicts with his past position    Bush began softening up We wrote this book last year  not this year  and we proposed a path to legalization  so anybody that had come illegally would have immediately a path to legalization  Bush said on MSNBC He added  If you can craft that in law  where you can have a path to citizenship where there isnt an incentive for people to come illegally  Im for it I dont have a problem with that He told CNN  I have supported both   both a path to legalization or a path to citizenship   with the underlying principle being that there should be no incentive for people to come illegally at the expense of coming legally Jaryn Emhof  Bushs communications director  told PolitiFact in an email  The book outlines a proposal by which immigrants    whether they are coming to work temporarily  to go to school  to live and work as permanent residents or seeking citizenship    can do so through an immigration process that would be much more open than before So  it is talking about future immigrants  not those currently here illegally We think its clear  however  that the books passages about legal status vs citizenship very clearly refer to those already here,3,0,1100,real
948,2009-03-02T19:08:08-05:00,2009,wwwvotesmartorg,John Boehner,The president campaigned against this type of legislation,Speaking on the House floor  Republican Leader John Boehner railed against a spending bill with some 9 000 earmarks  calling on President Obama to veto it and insist on one free of pet projects The president campaigned against this type of legislation  this number of earmarks  the Ohio Republican said on Feb 25  and I would hope that the president would veto this bill because Republicans in Congress will be here to uphold his veto of this piece of legislation Several news organizations made even harsher claims The New York Times   for example  reported that Obama would sign the bill  earmarks and all  despite campaign promises to put an end to the practice Thats incorrect Obama did not promise to end earmarking  only to reform it  and eliminate screwy or wasteful earmarks Boehner  however  was more careful than the New York Times His claim that Obama campaigned against this type of legislation could be read a number of ways Boehners spokesman  Michael Steel  said Boehner meant that Obama had broken his campaign pledges  referenced on the White House Web site   to slash earmarks to no greater than 1994 levels and ensure all spending decisions are open to the public Thats a reasonable interpretation of what Boehner said Obama did indeed make those pledges during the campaign Sen John McCain  the Republican candidate  pledged to eliminate earmarks and veto every earmark pork barrel bill  and Obama  though stopping short of that  did pledge to get tough on them For example  heres Obama in the first presidential debate   Absolutely  we need earmark reform And when Im president  I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely On March 10  2008  Obama said in a statement   We can no longer accept a process that doles out earmarks based on a member of Congress seniority  rather than the merit of the project We can no longer accept an earmarks process that has become so complicated to navigate that a municipality or nonprofit group has to hire high priced DC lobbyists to do it And we can no longer accept an earmarks process in which many of the projects being funded fail to address the real needs of our country And here he is on Feb 21  2008   I have been consistently in favor of more disclosure around earmarks Now  keep in mind a lot of these are worthy projects in our states  and I have actively pursued projects that I think are important But I want to make sure that theyre not done in the dark of night  that theyre not done in committee  that everybody stands up and says this is the kind of spending that I think is important The closest he came to saying he would eliminate earmarks  as far as we could find  was when he said  in the third presidential debate   Earmarks account for 05 percent of the total federal budget Theres no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on  and they need to be eliminated But its not going to solve the problem  Given his other campaign statements on earmarks  its clear he meant screwy  or wasteful  earmarks should be eliminated  not all earmarks  So the question is  is the omnibus spending bill the type of legislation that Obama campaigned against with respect to earmarks? That is  did it lack transparency  include earmarks based on a congressmans seniority and ones that are wasteful? And was the amount more than the 1994 level of  78 billion a year? The answer to most of those questions is largely yes  said Keith Ashdown  investigator for Taxpayers for Common Sense  a Washington watchdog group Ashdown said the earmarking process for the omnibus bill was not any more transparent than it was when Obama was campaigning He said seven of the top 10 earmark recipients in the Senate are on the Appropriations Committee  suggesting that access was more important than merit when it came to deciding what projects would get earmarks And though the total cost of the earmarks in the bill   77 billion  is slightly less than the 1994 level  there were another  66 billion in earmarks in three previous spending bills for this year that Congress passed last year Are there wasteful projects in the bill? Ashdown said he hasnt had time to research that There likely is  but I just dont know  he said He cautioned against leaping to conclusions about projects that sound goofy For example  some critics have mocked a  1 million earmark to control Mormon crickets in Utah   but Ashdown said the Mormon cricket  a type of katydid  is a very serious threat to agriculture The White House has argued that Obama should not be held responsible for the earmarking process in this legislative package   which is nine of the 12 spending bills for the current budget year rolled into one   because it is last years business And theres some truth to that These are bills that Congress was supposed to pass last year But that doesnt nullify Boehners point that the bill is   in featuring earmarks added by senior members of Congress in a process that lacked transparency and pushed earmark spending for the year well over  78 billion   the type of legislation Obama campaigned against,4,0,891,real
1337,2009-11-20T16:43:33-05:00,2009,wwwcbogov,Mike Enzi,The Senate health care bill would leave 24 million people without insurance coverage,Republican Sen Mike Enzi  whom Democrats had once hoped to woo for bipartisan support of a health care bill  attacked the version put forth on Nov 18  2009  by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid  D Nev Like the Pelosi bill  the Reid bill is government centered  not patient centered  Enzi said Its chock full of new taxes and higher health care costs that would threaten jobs  weaken our economy  punish families and small businesses trying to make ends meet  and stick our children and grandchildren with the bill Thats all pretty standard fare from Republican opponents of the Democratic health care plans being debated in Congress But we were intrigued by another criticism leveled by the Wyoming senator  that the Senate bill would leave 24 million people without insurance coverage That uninsured figure cited by Enzi comes from an analysis of the Reid bill by the Congressional Budget Office The report concludes that under the Reid bill  the share of legal nonelderly residents with insurance coverage would rise from about 83 percent currently to about 94 percent Specifically  the report estimated that the number of nonelderly people who are uninsured would be reduced by about 31 million by 2019  leaving about 24 million nonelderly residents uninsured So who are those 24 million who would be left uninsured? About a third of them are illegal immigrants  the CBO report states So who are the other two thirds  16 million  left uninsured? We asked three health care experts  John Holahan at the Urban Institute  Leighton Ku  a professor of health policy at George Washington University  and Kathleen D Stoll  director of Health Policy at Families USA They said those people mostly fall into several main categories    People who are deemed able to afford health insurance but simply decide the tax penalties are not high enough to persuade them to buy it Some young  healthy people  for example  may decide its cheaper to simply pay the tax penalty rather than purchase insurance  Stoll said The same is true for some wealthy people who are self insured These are basically people who say  Its not worth it to me   Ku said   People exempt from tax penalties because the cost of health insurance comes to more than 8 percent of their income  even if they are getting federal subsidies These are generally people with a lower income  but not so low as to qualify for Medicaid Without a penalty  many of those people may decide to continue not to buy insurance These are people on the lower end of the income scale  but not the poorest of the poor  Ku said  generally people who make anywhere from 133 percent to 300 percent of the poverty level   People who are eligible for Medicaid  but simply dont sign up Some people just think its a hassle to sign up for insurance  even when its free  Ku said About 60 percent of people eligible for Medicaid today simply dont sign up  Holahan said People with very low incomes dont always know how to navigate a lot of things in life People dont necessarily value health care  and they dont take the time to fill out the necessary paperwork   Then there are those who are in transitional stages of life    perhaps a job change    and dont take steps to close the insurance gaps between jobs The CBO report found that the Senate bill was less effective in reducing the number of uninsured compared to the version of the health care bill that passed the House While the Senate version was estimated to reduce the number of uninsured by 31 million  leaving 24 million uninsured   the House plan was estimated to reduce the number of uninsured by about 36 million  leaving about 18 million uninsured Thats largely because the House tax penalty for not getting insurance is a lot harsher Under the House bill  people who refuse to purchase health insurance will be hit with a tax penalty equivalent to 25 percent of their adjusted gross income The Senate plan calls for a tax penalty of  95 in 2014  going up to  350 in 2015   750 in 2016  and graduated up in ensuing years based on inflation adjustments Given differences between the House and Senate bills that cause the Senate plan to leave more uninsured  we certainly think its fair for a senator to criticize the plan in that regard But since this criticism comes from a Republican senator  we would be remiss if we did not point out several other political realities A CBO analysis of the main Republican health care plan  which was put forward by House Republican leader John Boehner  concluded it would reduce the number of uninsured by only about 3 million people  as opposed to 31 million in the Reid plan  It has not been a particularly high priority for the Republican Party to expand the number of people who get health insurance coverage  Ku said Again  a third of the people who would remain uninsured under the Reid plan are illegal immigrants You may recall that many Republicans criticized Democrats for not taking enough precautions to ensure that illegal immigrants are barred from a public option and also argued that illegal immigrants ought to be prohibited from buying insurance in any government sponsored health insurance exchange And the biggest factor accounting for fewer uninsured in the Reid plan  as opposed to the House plan  is that the Senate plan has less severe penalties for those who do not buy insurance But many conservatives have criticized Democrats for the mandate  arguing that the government ought not get involved in requiring health insurance Still  the bottom line is that Enzi said the Reid plan would leave 24 million people uninsured  and the CBO confirms that figure,2,0,960,real

I dont think they do  he said We had to know  Do new Medicare billing guidelines include nine codes for turkeys? Outdated codes First  a little background about this code thing Its not just a US system   its international  And in case you were wondering  it has nothing to do with Obamacare  The new set of diagnosis codes that Poe talked about is known as ICD 10  ICD stands for International Classification of Diseases Its published by the World Health Organization   then adapted for use in the United States The United States now uses ICD 9  which is more than three decades old Doctors offices use the codes to fill out Medicare and Medicaid claims  among other things Their billing and practice management software is based on them Their employees are trained to use them The American Medical Association says that depending on the size of the medical practice  itll cost  83 290 to more than  27 million to switch Doctors are dealing with so many other expensive regulatory changes  the association has begged since 2011 to delay or give up on the switch altogether Other countries have charged ahead They started to adopt the new set of codes nearly 20 years ago  and most developed countries now use it  according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS will require American doctors  indeed  any organization covered by the 1996 health care law known as HIPAA  to switch by Oct 1  2014 The federal government says the United States needs to upgrade partly because ICD 9 has outdated medical terms and not enough detail for accurate claims processing Claims for two different injuries might seem like duplicate filings if you couldnt specify right vs left hand   for example As Poe suggested  the new system does have far more diagnosis codes than the version developed in the 1970s   68 000 instead of 13 000  Poe  in his Stossel interview  said the new system has 140 000 codes  but thats only if you group both diagnosis and procedure codes   not a direct comparison with 13 000  How much detail are we talking? The codes allow doctors to specify not just injuries from turkeys  but from parrots  macaws  ducks and geese Theres a different code for being struck vs pecked or suffering from other contact  with specification for the first time  an unlucky repeat or even worse   sequela   That would be some negative afteraffect resulting from your turkey encounter Headaches!

651,2008-08-25T00:00:00-04:00,2008,wwwdemconventioncom,Democratic National Committee,More than 12 500 service men and women have been discharged on the basis of sexual orientation since the Dont Ask  Dont Tell policy was implemented  at a cost of over  360 million Many of those forced out had special skills in high demand  such as translators  engineers  and pilots,The Democratic Partys draft platform   entitled Renewing Americas Promise  promises to repeal the militarys Dont Ask  Dont Tell policy That policy grew out of a furious political battle in the early days of President Bill Clintons administration  when he considered lifting the Pentagons longstanding ban on gays in the military Under a compromise that took effect in 1994  the military would not ask about servicemembers sexual orientation  and gay persons could serve as long as they were silent about that aspect of their lives The DNC platform says Dont Ask  Dont Tell wastes money and disqualifies valuable personnel Under the heading  Allow All Americans to Serve  the platform says  We will also put national security above divisive politics More than 12 500 service men and women have been discharged on the basis of sexual orientation since the Dont Ask  Dont Tell policy was implemented  at a cost of over  360 million Many of those forced out had special skills in high demand  such as translators  engineers  and pilots At a time when the military is having a tough time recruiting and retaining troops  it is wrong to deny our country the service of brave  qualified people We support the repeal of Dont Ask  Dont Tell and the implementation of policies to allow qualified men and women to serve openly regardless of sexual orientation Since the DNC justified its position with statistics  we want to see if those statistics hold up The claim that more than 12 500 service men and women have been discharged on the basis of sexual orientation since the Dont Ask Dont Tell policy was implemented seems to be accurate The Pentagon was unable to provide us promptly with its count  but a February 2005 Government Accountability Office report said 9 488 servicemembers had been ousted for homosexual conduct between the start of the policy in 1994 and the end of fiscal year 2003 When we asked the Democratic National Committee where the number came from  they referred us to the Obama campaign  which in turn sent us to the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network  an advocacy group for gay servicemembers The groups spokesman  Adam Ebbins  said it files Freedom of Information Act requests each year to get the most recent number  and that the last count  as of the end of fiscal year 2007  was 12 342 members discharged  with no response from the Coast Guard At this point we are confident that the number of discharges has exceeded 12 500  Ebbins said He said the military documents supporting that number were too cumbersome to provide promptly  but by our count the GAO report suggests a discharge rate of 26 service members per day  which would place the current total well over 12 000 So the defense networks number is quite plausible  and we see no reason to question it Onto the DNCs claim that many of those forced out had special skills in high demand The GAO report said 757 of those discharged for homosexuality  or 8 percent  held critical occupations  meaning jobs worthy of selective reenlistment bonuses  and of those 322 had some skills in important foreign languages such as Arabic  Farsi or Korean So yes  that qualifies as many  and the claim was accurate The third aspect of the partys claim   that the policy cost more than  360 million   is less clear It seems odd to us that a debate of this sort would bog down over money  we suspect those who feel strongly on either side of this debate believe it should be decided on issues such as equality or military readiness  not cost Nevertheless  volumes have been written on the cost of the policy  so lets have at it In its 2005 report  the GAO said that over the 10 year period it could have cost the Department of Defense  1905 million to recruit and train replacements for servicemembers lost due to the policy But the office cautioned that the total costs of DODs homosexual conduct policy cannot be estimated because DOD does not collect relevant cost data on inquiries and investigations  counseling and pastoral care  separation functions  and discharge reviews A year later the Michael D Palm Center at the University of California  Santa Barbara  wrote a competing financial Analysis of Dont Ask Dont Tell   and concluded that the policy cost at least  3638 million between 1994 and 2003 The DNC used that number The California commission comprised former Secretary of Defense William Perry  a former assistant defense secretary  two former military officers  a military law expert  and six professors  including two from West Point and two from the Naval Postgraduate School  It had its research design and report reviewed and vetted by Mary Malina  a professor at the Graduate School of Business and Public Policy at the Naval Postgraduate school  and an expert in cost accounting  management control systems and managerial accounting practice The commission found that the GAO overestimated one aspect of the cost of the policy   adding the cost of replacing those fired for being gay but failing to offset that with the value recovered through the time served by the replacement In two other respects  though  the GAO underestimated the cost  the commission found It did not include the cost of training officers who were discharged for homosexuality  and for enlistees  it used an inaccurate estimate of training costs per person Bottom line  the California commission came up with a cost 91 percent higher than the GAOs The GAO fired back  critiquing the commissions report in July 2006 It said 90 percent of the gap between its estimate and the commissions was due to differing estimates of enlistee training costs Our estimate focused largely on the direct and incremental training costs associated with the specific occupations of servicemembers  the GAO wrote The Commission based its estimate on average training costs for all occupations indexed for inflation The office defended its estimated in other respects as well  and stood by its number The California commission chair  University of California associate political science professor Aaron Belkin  answered back in September 2006 with a critique of the GAOs critique of his critique of their report Still with us? Belkin said that in its defense of its estimate the GAO did not acknowledge the implications of its failure to obtain length of training data and misrepresents its own training cost data Were getting way into the weeds here  and as Belkin said in an interview  With any accounting story you have multiple truths because accounting can be calculated in different ways That said  two factors compel us to approve of the DNCs claim that the policy has cost over  360 million For one thing  both the GAO and the California estimates are now five years out of date  and even the GAOs methodology would yield an estimate much higher than  190 million today   it might well even reach  360 million Secondly  the GAO acknowledged in its 2005 report that it was not trying to provide a complete estimate   in fact  the title of its report was Financial Costs and Loss of Critical Skills Due to DODs Homosexual Conduct Policy Cannot Be Completely Estimated The California commission did endeavor to provide a complete estimate  and it drew on extensive expertise to do so Therefore  its estimate is the best available measure of the cost of Dont Ask  Dont Tell,1,0,1227,real

How long do we have to stay in South Korea? How long are we going to stay in Japan? How long are we going to stay in Germany? All of those  50   60 year period No one complains In fact  they contribute enormously  their presence  to stability in the world  McCain said The point is  its American casualties Weve got to get Americans off the front line  have the Iraqis as part of the strategy  take over more and more of the responsibilities And then I dont think Americans are concerned if were there for 100 years or 1 000 years or 10 000 years What they care about is a sacrifice of our most precious treasure  and thats American blood So what Im saying is look  if Americans are there in a support role  but theyre not taking casualties  thats fine When McCain was asked about the remark Jan 9 on ABCs Good Morning America  he said the US presence could last 1 million years  Could be 1 000 years or a million years  he said We have bases in Kuwait right now We have bases in South Korea and Japan  Germany I mean  the allegation by critics is  a straw man Its a fallacious argument by people who dont understand that its not American presence  its American casualties If we can get American casualties down and eliminate them  Americans are not concerned   in fact  they may be glad we have a secure base in that part of the world as we do in Kuwait The interviews show McCain is not advocating that the war in Iraq continue for a thousand years  or a million  But once combat ends and US casualities dwindle  he expects the United States could have troops in Iraq similar to the presence in South Korea and Germany That presence could continue for many years Clinton correctly described the first remark by saying Sen McCain said the other day that we might have troops  in Iraq  for 100 years We gave that a True But Obama twisted McCains words in the Cleveland debate He said  We are bogged down in a war that John McCain now suggests might go on for another 100 years As we explain above  McCain was referring to a peacetime presence  not the war So we find Obamas statement False VoteVets is a veterans group that opposes the Bush administration policy in Iraq and is backing nine Democratic congressional candidates who are veterans VoteVets has joined a coalition of liberal leaning groups such as MoveOnorg that will be running ads against McCain The VoteVets ad does not make the mistake Obama does It says  John McCain says its okay with him if the US spends the next thousand years in Iraq,4,0,928,real
1279,2009-10-23T19:02:30-04:00,2009,wwwfoxnewscom,Dick Cheney,The Obama administration notified Poland and the Czech Republic about cancellation of major missile defense facilities at the last minute in midnight phone calls,Former Vice President Dick Cheney made news on Oct 21  2009  when he accused the White House of dithering while Americas armed forces are in danger in Afghanistan That was just one of many fireballs he lobbed at the Obama administrations policies on Iran  Iraq and the interrogation of suspected terrorists Cheney also rapped the White House for sloppy diplomacy in its decision to cancel a planned missile defense radar in the Czech Republic and planned missile interceptors in Poland The administration decided that the facilities were designed with a less severe threat   long range missiles   in mind  and that missile defense efforts should instead be focused on countering short  and medium range missiles Work on the missile defense facilities   which had prompted strenuous opposition from Russia and mixed feelings by residents of the two Eastern European countries   was conceived during the tenure of Cheney and President George W Bush So Cheneys opposition to Obamas canceling the project was not surprising However  in his speech  Cheney went beyond the substance of the decision and accused the White House of bumbling diplomatic protocol in making its announcement It is certainly not a model of diplomacy when the leaders of Poland and the Czech Republic are informed of such a decision at the last minute in midnight phone calls  Cheney told an awards dinner sponsored by the Center for Security Policy  a conservative group It took a long time and lot of political courage in those countries to arrange for our interceptor system in Poland and the radar system in the Czech Republic Our Polish and Czech friends are entitled to wonder how strategic plans and promises years in the making could be dissolved  just like that   with apparently little  if any  consultation Seventy years to the day after the Soviets invaded Poland  it was an odd way to mark the occasion In this item  we will try to determine the timing of when the Obama administration told the Czech Republic and Poland of the decision According to many news accounts  Czech Prime Minister Jan Fischer was indeed told shortly after midnight  Warsaw time  on Thursday  Sept 17  2009  That is  indeed  the 70th anniversary of the Soviet invasion  Just after midnight I was informed  Fischer said  according to the Independent   a British newspaper The Russian newspaper Vremya Novostey pinpointed the call to 12 21 in the morning A call received at 12 21 am in Warsaw would have been placed six hours earlier   6 21 pm in Washington News of the decision began to leak out the following morning  Washington time CNN  for example  reported the decision in its 9 am block of CNN Newsroom  Obama announced it at 10 21 am in a brief address in the White Houses Diplomatic Reception Room So  the time between Obamas call to Fischer and the formal White House announcement was about 16 hours  most of which was nighttime in one country or the other Pinning down the time that Obama contacted Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk is a little trickier According to Agence France Presse   the Czech leader said that Poland had been informed in the same way as he himself had been But the Russian paper  Vremya Novostey   citing Polish news media reports  said that a technical glitch prevented Obama from speaking to Tusk late Wednesday night  so the conversation took place only  on Thursday  afternoon  We presume that is Warsaw time  If Obama did finally make personal contact with Tusk that late  it still would have been before the formal White House announcement  though barely The White House declined to provide additional details about the timing By way of context  its worth noting that the announcement was not exactly a surprise After Obamas announcement  Fischer himself said that we knew the United States was reviewing its plan to build the radar  within a reassessment of specific threats  and that one option might be to give up the plan to build the radar  according to Agence France Presse  The threats now rest in short  and medium range missiles  not long range ones The American side decided this was the most serious threat and this is their reaction Its not clear why the White House chose to make the announcement when it did Obama still had six days left if he wanted to get the news out before world leaders arrived in New York for the United Nations General Assembly Asked by Sen Susan Collins  R Maine  at a Senate Armed Services hearing whether the announcement could have been handled any better  undersecretary of defense Michele Flournoy blamed leak fueled speculation We too would have preferred a longer period for consultation and rollout  but leaks and speculation in the press sort of forced us to go sooner to set

608,2008-08-05T00:00:00-04:00,2008,wwwyoutubecom,Barack Obama,We could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling  if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups,UPDATED This item has been updated  but our ruling didnt change See below Sen Barack Obama injected a startling claim into the debate on energy  asserting in a Missouri town hall meeting that the country could save more gas from inflating its tires and tuning up its cars than would be gained from drilling more off its coasts There are things that you can do individually  though  to save energy  Obama said in the July 30  2008  appearance Making sure your tires are properly inflated   simple thing But we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling  if everybody was just inflating their tires  and getting regular tune ups You could actually save just as much Sen John McCain and his allies   who advocate lifting the federal moratorium that bans drilling in some areas of the Outer Continental Shelf off the US coasts   immediately mocked Obama for the claim The McCain campaign even offered to send Obama Energy Plan tire gauges to anyone who sent in a donation of  25 or more The McCain campaigns assumption seemed to be that Obamas claim was utterly implausible And  we admit  it kind of sounds that way But is it? Under inflated tires   to say nothing of poorly tuned cars   are actually a serious problem  as government agencies  industry groups  conservationists and outside experts have been saying for years  The Obama campaign even cited a number of instances when prominent McCain supporters echoed the call for more public awareness about tire inflation  A lot of people are driving around on severely under inflated tires  said Robert Sinclair  Jr  a spokesman for the American Automobile Association Try riding a bicycle with under inflated tires Its hard for the human engine to push it ahead Pump it up  it seems like youre gliding on air The same thing happens with a car Under inflated tires can lower gas mileage by 4 percent for every 1 pounds per square inch drop in tire pressure  according to the US Department of Energy The best estimate available  by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  is that at least a quarter of drivers are cruising around on under inflated tires In April  the Rubber Manufacturers Association  the Auto Club  the California Highway Patrol and Yokohama Tire Company used those statistics  along with Department of Transportation and Automobile Association of America data  to extrapolate that 28 billion gallons of gas are lost every year due to under inflation of tires Thats an estimate  to be sure  and not one from a published  peer reviewed study But remember  Obama said we could save all the oil available from offshore drilling in the protected areas   not we would   so if the claim is merely plausible hes on solid ground So how much oil is available offshore? According to the latest assessment from the Minerals Management Service  the mean estimate of undiscovered technically recoverable crude oil in the Outer Continental Shelf areas that are currently under moratorium is about 18 billion barrels  see here   But it couldnt all be extracted immediately The agency estimates that if the moratorium were lifted production could start by 2017  and by 2030  oil companies could be producing 24 million barrels of oil instead of 22 million Thats 200 000 more barrels per day After refining  a barrel of oil can produce up to 195 gallons of gasoline  according to the US Department of Energy So thats 39 million more gallons of gasoline per day  or 14 billion gallons of gasoline per year And remember  an estimated 28 billion gallons of gas are lost annually due to under inflated tires And we didnt even talk about tune ups  Repairing a car that is noticeably out of tune or has failed an emissions test improves gas mileage by 4 percent on average  according to the US Department of Energy Fixing a more serious problem  such as a bad oxygen sensor  can improve mileage by up to 40 percent  the agency says  All of the numbers in this analysis are estimates  we should emphasize Oil industry experts told us estimates of the amount of oil offshore and how fast it could be extracted vary widely  and the Energy Information Administrations number is fairly optimistic Likewise  its highly unlikely any public awareness effort could change behavior enough to save 28 billion gallons of gasoline per day For these reasons  we ruled this claim to be True Update  After we published this item  McCain spokesman Michael Goldfarb called to dispute it  citing a Government Accountability Office letter of Feb 9  2007 that says tire inflation wastes 12 billion gallons of gasoline instead of the 28 billion estimate we used The letter says  The Department of Energys designated economist on this issue indicated that  of the 130 billion gallons of fuel that the Transportation Research Board estimated were used in passenger cars and light trucks in 2005  about 12 billion gallons were wasted as a result of driving on under inflated tires That estimate falls just under the estimated 14 billion gallons a year from increased offshore drilling But that doesnt persuade us to change our ruling  for three reasons First  12 billion gallons in possible savings from proper tire inflation is still in the ballpark of the 14 billion gallons from drilling Given that all of these numbers are estimates  its hard to say the difference between these two numbers constitutes a falsehood Second  it would take years of work to start producing 14 billion gallons of gasoline from oil pumped offshore    the Energy Information Administration estimate contemplates production beginning in 2017 And the oil reserves would not be bottomless Conceivably  the savings from tire pressure correction could begin immediately and last indefinitely  thus easily overcoming the marginal difference in the estimates provided by the McCain campaign And finally  none of this takes into account the impact of tune ups  which Obama mentioned as part of his claim If Department of Energy estimates of 4 percent mileage improvement for better tuned cars are true  that alone would push the total savings above the estimated drilling yield Goldfarb also pointed out that barrels of oil  in addition to yielding 195 gallons of gasoline  yield other products as well  such as jet fuel  lubricants and feed stocks Point taken  but Obamas statement was made within the context of the current drilling debate  which has been about increasing the supply of domestic oil to ease the strain on the US transportation sector In the end  estimates are all we have to work with here Estimates of oil production  estimates of gasoline savings For our purposes in evaluating Obamas claim  all the available evidence shows that hes on solid ground in saying that better car and tire maintenance would save as much gasoline as drilling would generate We appreciate McCains campaign pointing out a GAO source wed missed in our original research  but its not at odds with our original ruling  True,2,0,1160,real

Heres the point  Hannity said  Barack Obama wont even use the term war on terrorism  because hes apologizing to America in every Muslim country he can Weve heard a number of conservative radio and talk show hosts criticize President Obama for not using the global war on terrorism phrase adopted by his predecessor  George W Bush And so we decided to check it out We did a word search of Obamas public statements and could not find that Obama has used the phrase war on terrorism as president  though he said it numerous times as a candidate And early in his presidency  Obama used the phrase war on terror  but only a couple of times So what gives? We found two instances where Obama directly addressed the question The first was during a Jan 27  2009  interview by Hisham Melhem with al Aribiya  an Arabic language television news station Melhem noted that Obama seemed to eschew Bushs phrase war on terror and frame it in a different way  specifically against one group called al Qaida and their collaborators Obama  I think that youre making a very important point And that is that the language we use matters And what we need to understand is  is that there are extremist organizations    whether Muslim or any other faith in the past    that will use faith as a justification for violence We cannot paint with a broad brush a faith as a consequence of the violence that is done in that faiths name And so you will  I think  see our administration be very clear in distinguishing between organizations like al Qaida    that espouse violence  espouse terror and act on it    and people who may disagree with my administration and certain actions  or may have a particular viewpoint in terms of how their countries should develop We can have legitimate disagreements but still be respectful I cannot respect terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians  and we will hunt them down But to the broader Muslim world what we are going to be offering is a hand of friendship The issue was again raised in a Feb 3  2009  interview with CNNs Anderson Cooper  Cooper  Ive noticed you dont use the term war on terror I think I read an article that youve only used it once since inauguration Is that conscious? Is there something about that term you find objectionable or not useful? Obama  Well  you know  I think it is very important for us to recognize that we have a battle or a war against some terrorist organizations But that those organizations arent representative of a broader Arab community  Muslim community  You know  words matter in this situation because one of the ways were going to win this struggle is through the battle of hearts and minds Cooper  So thats not a term youre going to be using much in the future? Obama  You know  what I want to do is make sure that Im constantly talking about al Qaida and other affiliated organizations because we  I believe  can win over moderate Muslims to recognize that that kind of destruction and nihilism ultimately leads to a dead end  and that we should be working together to make sure that everybody has got a better life So Obama isnt fond of the phrase war on terror But did that ever become blanket White House policy? According to a Washington Post story in March  a memo e mailed to Pentagon staff members from the Defense Departments office of security review said this administration prefers to avoid using the term Long War or Global War on Terror Please use Overseas Contingency Operation  According to the memo  the direction came from the White House Office of Management and Budget  which reviews speeches given by administration officials Kenneth Baer  an OMB spokesman  told the Washington Post there was no such guidance  that it was only the opinion of a career civil servant Still  you dont hear administration officials using the term war on terror  or the like  very often Obama was criticized in some circles when he failed to even utter the words terror or terrorism in a June 4  2009  speech in Cairo  Egypt  directed to Muslims around the world The absence of those words goes to the heart of Obamas new approach  said John O Brennan  assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism  who provided perhaps the clearest and most in depth explanation of the White House lexicon in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Aug 6  2009 As many have noted  the president does not describe this as a war on terrorism  Instead  as the president has made clear  we are at war with al Qaida  which attacked us on 9 11 and killed 3 000 people We are at war with its violent extremist allies who seek to carry on al Qaidas murderous agenda These are the terrorists we will destroy These are the extremists we will defeat Brennan warned that it would be wrong for people to conclude that Obama is not committed to fighting terrorism President Obama has articulated a clear policy   to disrupt  dismantle  and defeat al Qaida and its allies  Brennan said That is our mission  and the president described it in no uncertain terms in his inaugural when he said  Our nation is at war against a far reaching network of violence and hatred And to win this war against al Qaida  the administration continues to be unrelenting  using every tool in our toolbox and every arrow in our quiver Our aim here is not to wade into the war of words over the war on terror Rather  we just wanted to see if Hannity was right that Obama wont use the term war on terrorism And except in a couple of instances where he used the phrase war on terror  Obama has generally employed different words And its deliberate  as he has explained on several occasions Obama provides nuanced explanations for his word choices  and you may agree or disagree with them  but the bottom line is that Obama has chosen not to use the phrase war on terrorism,6,0,1110,real

Buffetts op ed says his tax rate is lower than his employees because money made off investments is taxed at a lower rate than wage income If you make money with money  as some of my super rich friends do  your percentage may be a bit lower than mine But if you earn money from a job  your percentage will surely exceed mine   most likely by a lot  Buffett said Personal income is taxed based on how much a person makes each year In 2016  the brackets range from 10 percent for those making  9 275 or less  to a top marginal rate of 396 percent for those making  415 051 or more Meanwhile  the tax rate on long term capital gains    the profits from investments    is 15 percent However  if the taxpayers taxable income is greater than  415 051  their long term capital gains are taxed at 20 percent Here are the current rates for a single taxpayer On Oct 10  2016  Buffett released details about his personal tax data in a statement titled  Some Tax Facts for Donald Trump He says he paid  185 million in federal taxes in 2015  and his adjusted gross income was  116 million That means he paid 159 percent in effective federal income tax Lawrence Zelenak  a Duke University law professor  said in an email most taxpayers with incomes in the low six figures have a higher rate than 16 percent Thats true even if you consider only federal income tax Add in payroll tax and Buffets rate becomes even lower compared with his secretary  he said Payroll taxes are separate from income taxes  and are deducted by your employer before you get your paycheck These taxes pay for Medicare and Social Security The employee tax rate for Social Security is typically 62 percent of your gross income  up to  113 700  and 145 percent on all income for Medicare These two rates are not progressive or applied to all income  so as income increases  they make up a smaller percentage of the total income Since Buffett makes the majority of his money from investments  his wage income    and therefore his payroll taxes    are low But those who work for a living  especially those who make higher than average salaries  get taxed at higher rates We dont know what salary Buffetts secretary earns  but its likely much higher than the median pay for secretaries  Remember that Buffett is one of the richest men in the world  A study from the nonpartisan The Tax Policy Center says that people making between  100 000 and  200 000 pay an average 196 percent in taxes  including payroll and income taxes,1,0,744,real

We should first note that there is significant disagreement over what is  or should be  considered an assault weapon  For instance  even though the Facebook post references Obamas intention to ban semi automatic rifles  California law already includes some types of handguns and shotguns in its definition of assault weapon That said  well take a look at the number of deaths caused by rifles To check the post  we looked at the 2011 edition of the FBIs annual Crime in the United States report  The report breaks down the types of weapons used in murder These are the statistics for 2011  the most recent year available  The Facebook post and the FBI stats are closely in tune Except for a minor typo in the Facebook posts number for deaths by hands  fists or feet  the numbers are accurate The number cited for rifles was somewhat less precise While its true that the FBI counted 323 murders by rifles  the agency also counted 1 587 murders by an undetermined type of firearm and 97 by other guns If gun usage in these two categories followed the same pattern as other gun homicides  that would add another 75 or so murders by rifle  making an estimate for the number of rifle murders about 400  rather than 323 Still  the larger point holds  Murders by knives  blunt objects and body parts each individually outweighed those committed using a rifle We should note that while the Facebook posts comparison is accurate as far as it goes  it does ignore the single biggest category of weapons used in murders    handguns Handguns were used in 6 220 cases  or 72 percent of all firearm murders in 2011 and slightly under half of all murders using any kind of weapon that year This caveat illustrates how the selection and framing of statistics can be used to bolster one side or the other in the gun debate,1,0,405,real

From time to time  there has been discussion of whether a new category    Category 6    should be added to the scale That decision would likely fall to the National Hurricane Center after discussions with scientists in the field  said Jill Trepanier  a hurricane specialist in the Louisiana State University department of geography and anthropology A simple extrapolation from the existing categories would probably set the threshold for a new Category 6 around 180 mph  making Irma a good candidate for that category if it existed  said James B Elsner  the chair of geography at Florida State University who also runs a business called Climatek that develops software for hurricane and tornado risk models The idea of creating a Category 6 is often met with skepticism  however The most frequently cited reason is that Category 6 would add nothing to the understanding of how destructive the storm would be for buildings and other structures Almost no structures can withstand sustained winds over 155 mph  said Michael M Bell  an associate professor in atmospheric science at Colorado State University At those wind speeds  significant damage or even total destruction of most buildings is expected By this definition  adding a Category 6 would not add any new information  since the strongest criteria for expected wind damage has already been met Bill Read  the former director of the National Hurricane Center  agreed in an email with PolitiFact And the scales co creator  Simpson  agreed as well  in a 1991 interview Asked whether the scale should be modified to include categories above 5  he said that above 155 mph  its going to cause rupturing damages  to buildings  that are serious no matter how well its engineered  Thats the reason why we didnt try to go any higher than that anyway In fact  several scientists said that a more useful change  if one had to be made  would be to focus less on wind speed specifically  either by modifying the Saffir Simpson scale to include other factors or by giving added attention to other measurements I personally believe that we need to work on effectively communicating the other hazards that tropical cyclones bring  including heavy rainfall and storm surge  Bell said Hurricane Harvey  which hit coastal Texas  did cause significant wind damage as a Category 4  but much of the devastation in Houston and the surrounding areas was caused by inland flooding from sustained rainfall while Harvey was a tropical storm Similarly  much of the damage from Hurricane Katrina was caused by storm surge when the winds were Category 3  Bell said These multiple hazards may not be well correlated with the Saffir Simpson Category at landfall  and therefore it is an incomplete description of the storms destructive potential Trepanier said theres no reason why a Category 6 is needed to communicate how fearsome Irma is Irma is a beast  she said It is safe to say the wind speeds are rare  but I see no benefit in calling it a Category 6 It should be considered catastrophic And that is how people should refer to it So  as of now  there is no such thing as a Category 6 storm The web post suggesting that Irma is one rates Pants on Fire,1,0,1189,fake
1202,2009-09-21T13:52:52-04:00,2009,wwwwhitehousegov,Michelle Obama,In some states  it is still legal to deny a woman coverage because shes been the victim of domestic violence,In his effort to pass a health care overhaul  President Barack Obama has enlisted help from a close ally   his wife  Michelle On Sept 18  2009  the first lady gave a speech about the importance of health care reform to women  and cited several reasons she thinks the current system is gender biased This line caught our attention  Women are affected because  as we heard  in many states  insurance companies can still discriminate because of gender  she said And this is still shocking to me These are the kind of facts that still wake me up at night  In some states  it is still legal to deny a woman coverage because shes been the victim of domestic violence Health reform bills under consideration by Congress would prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage based on pre exisiting conditions  an issue weve already explored   weve also examined how pregnancy can sometimes be a basis to deny coverage  and how pre exisiting conditions already lead to health care rationing by private health insurers But wed never heard domestic abuse could count as a pre existing condition  so we decided to look into the claim The issue first came to light in 1994  when a Pennsylvania woman was denied health  life and mortgage disability insurance because of domestic violence  according to the Womens Law Project That group  along with the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence  began advocating for legislation to expressly prohibit the practice Since then  most states  including Pennsylvania  have adopted laws prohibiting the practice But  as Mrs Obama said in her speech  denying coverage due to a history of domestic abuse is still legal in some states Those states are Idaho  Mississippi  North Carolina  North Dakota  Oklahoma  South Carolina  South Dakota and Wyoming  and the District of Columbia  according to the National Womens Law Center The claim has become a popular talking point for groups supporting health care reform such as the Service Employees International Union  Its been discussed so much recently that Arkansas  which had no prohibition  this year passed a law prohibiting discrimination against domestic violence victims  A Huffington Post story about the laws last week prompted several states and insurance companies to say that the laws have been changed or that the companies dont treat domestic violence as a pre existing condition The North Carolina situation is a matter of some disagreement Although the Womens Law Center says the practice is still allowed  state officials say they interpret the laws to mean it is not Mississippi Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney told the Jackson Free Press that he wanted to explore whether insurance companies were taking advantage of the law  Ive got to get some of my lawyers to do some research on this  but we have only six mandated  conditions that must be covered  in our state statues  and we have 25 or more optional coverages  but domestic abuse doesnt seem to be one of them  The whole situation is bad Lets say a woman works with a company that had Blue Cross Blue Shield  and she gets beat up in her house and Blue Cross says were not covering you because getting beat up is your pre existing condition Thats terrible Meanwhile  Wyoming Department of Insurance staff attorney James Mitchell told the Huffington Post that state law does not expressly prohibit insurers from using domestic abuse as grounds to deny coverage  though hed found no cases of the practice in his state Mitchells response raises an important point  Just because its legal in some states for insurance companies to cite domestic violence as a pre existing condition  it doesnt mean that insurance companies are actually taking advantage of the loophole Back in the 1990s there was evidence that the practice was widespread In 1994  a House Judiciary Committee panel conducted an informal survey and found that eight of the 16 largest insurers in the country used domestic violence as a factor in deciding coverage And a year later  the Insurance Commission of Pennsylvania reported that a formal survey showed that 24 percent of accident  health and life insurers took domestic violence into account when deciding whether to issue and renew insurance policies But that data is more than 10 years old  so we asked Lisa Codispoti  senior counsel for the National Womens Law Center  if insurance companies are still denying health care coverage based on domestic violence history Examples are hard to come by  she said  because people who get coverage through an employer dont usually face exclusions about pre existing condititions Only people who apply for individual coverage would  she said Its such a small number of people who apply for individual insurance  she said And its not like insurance companies have to tell you why youre being denied coverage Indeed  underwriting standards are private  said Nancy Durborow  health projects coordinator for the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence  making it difficult for groups such as hers to find out how widespread the practice still is This is very secretive stuff  she said A spokesman for the association representing insurance companies told us hes not aware of any insurers that deny women coverage based on history of domestic abuse And the group supports a proposal by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that would fully prohibit the practice No one should be denied coverage because they are victims of domestic abuse  said Robert Zirkelbach  a spokesman for Americas Health Insurance Plans We find that the first lady is correct that in some states  it is still legal to deny a woman coverage because shes been the victim of domestic violence Putting aside the disputed North Carolina law  there still are several other states   including Mississippi and Wyoming   that  have no specific laws prohibiting the practice Its important to note that we couldnt find this was happening on a widespread basis

Glad you asked Lobbyists are people who are hired to persuade members of Congress on a particular issue They are brought in by many different industries  from private companies like Microsoft or ExxonMobil  to associations representing local governments  to nonprofits focused on hot button legislation Some organizations have in house lobbyists  and others hire large firms that lobby Congress on a variety of topics We first checked in with the Lundergan Grimes campaign to see where they got their numbers They linked us to a report by Open Secrets  a nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog website run by the Center for Responsive Politics The report  titled Sincere or Strategic  Lobbyists Give Big  looked at trends in donations from federally registered lobbyists If a company or organization spends a certain amount of money lobbying Congress  theyre required to register with the federal government Open Secrets checks this database against the campaign finance disclosure reports that candidates file Open Secrets found that the 25 lobbyists who have contributed the most money to campaigns this cycle have already donated  19 million Contributions are not party exclusive  five of those 25 gave strictly to Republicans  11 gave to Democrats and a handful gave to both Open Secrets also released a list of the members of Congress who have received the most donations from lobbyists during the campaign cycle  since the start of 2013  With  281 301 in contributions from lobbyists  McConnell topped the list  followed closely by House Speaker John Boehner at  278 380 McConnell has also received another  50 000 from family members of lobbyists Heres the top 10  As you can see  its a hodgepodge of Democrats and Republicans rounding out the list  but the two most powerful Republicans in Congress lead the way  by quite a bit This list doesnt count the Massachusetts special election race in 2013 to replace Secretary of State John Kerry  won by Democrat Ed Markey Markey raised about  306 000 from lobbyists between that special election and his 2014 re election race  so he technically leads the cycle A spokeswoman for Open Secrets said that when Lundergan Grimes made her statement  the organization had not yet updated their website with Markeys contributions Markeys situation  though  is a quirky anomaly  because he was in the unusual position of running twice in one campaign cycle McConnell isnt just the top congressional recipient of donations from lobbyists According to his Open Secrets profile   he has also received more money than any other lawmaker since 2013 from a number of industries Hes No 1 in campaign donations from people who work in the fields of   deep breath here   agriculture services  air transportation  auto dealers and manufacturers  building materials  business associations  coal mining  commercial banks  commercial TV and radio stations  electric utilities  food and beverage  food stores  general contractors  health services  home builders  insurance  medical devices and supplies  mining  mortgage bankers and brokers  pharmaceutical and health products  railroads  retirees  steel production and trucking When he last ran for re election in 2008   McConnell  who was minority leader at the time  topped the list in two industries  coal mining and tobacco He was fourth in contributions from lobbyists Its worth noting that in 2010 when Majority Leader Harry Reid was up for re election  he benefited most from lobbyist contributions as well With  947 000 in donations from lobbyists   Reid received nearly  300 000 more from lobbyists than the next closest lawmaker So its not uncommon for party leaders to receive significant financial backing during their re election fights For her part  Lundergan Grimes has received  54 699 from lobbyists  51st among candidates running in 2014,1,0,774,real
934,2009-02-10T17:34:27-05:00,2009,wwwnytimescom,Barack Obama,Putting three Republicans in my Cabinetis unprecedented,UPDATE  This claim was accurate when President Obama said it As you can see below in the original item  it is indeed unprecedented to have three Cabinet members from the opposite party The circumstances changed on Feb 12  2009  three days after Obamas statement  when Sen Gregg withdrew  But because we rule on statements based on the wording and timing of statements  were keeping this one as a True Obama was correct when he said it on Feb 9  for the way he said it So far  the votes on the massive economic stimulus package have fallen starkly along partisan lines The bill that passed the House didnt get a single Republican vote  and the version that passed the Senate got a grand total of three During a news conference on Feb 9  2009  in which President Obama made his case for the stimulus plan  he was asked if pressing forward despite Republican objections meant the White House is moving away from its emphasis on bipartisanship You know  when I made a series of overtures to the Republicans   going over to meet with both Republican caucuses  you know  putting three Republicans in my Cabinet  something that is unprecedented  making sure that they were invited here to the White House to talk about the economic recovery plan   all those were not designed simply to get some short term votes  Obama said They were designed to try to build up some trust over time  And I think that as I continue to make these overtures  over time hopefully that will be reciprocated We decided to check out whether Obama can accurately claim that his three Republican Cabinet appointments represent a bipartisan high water mark in presidential history For starters  were going to give Obama three Republicans  though a stickler could point out that Defense Secretary Robert Gates isnt actually registered as a Republican But hes Republican enough in our book Gates has served under several Republican administrations  and though he dropped his party registration to present an apolitical appearance while with the CIA  Gates himself said in December  I consider myself a Republican The other two Obama appointees are card carrying Republicans  Ray LaHood  a former congressman from Illinois  as secretary of transportation  and Sen Judd Gregg of New Hampshire as commerce secretary  though he has not yet been confirmed  And Obama is right No other president has had this many For a little perspective  heres a rundown of the crossovers from a centurys worth of presidential Cabinets    George W Bush  Democrat Norman Mineta  transportation secretary   Bill Clinton  Republican William Cohen  defense secretary   George H W Bush  nada   Ronald Reagan  William Bennett was a Democrat when appointed as education secretary in 1985  but the following year  he became a Republican and has remained a conservative Republican voice ever since   Jimmy Carter  Republican James Schlesinger  who served as defense secretary under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford  was tapped by Carter as Americas first energy secretary   Richard Nixon  Daniel Patrick Moynihan served as ambassador to the United Nations  which at the time was not a Cabinet level position   John F Kennedy  Republicans C Douglas Dillon as treasury secretary and Robert McNamara as defense secretary McNamara wasnt such a stretch though  as Time m agazine pointed out at the time  In politics  McNamara is a lukewarm  liberal Republican who often contributes to Democratic candidates This year he voted for Kennedy   Dwight D Eisenhower  Democrat and Labor Secretary Martin Patrick Durkin  the plumber among Eisenhowers so called Nine Millionaires and a Plumber Cabinet Durkin was replaced in 1953 by fellow Democrat James P Mitchell  a so called Democrat for Eisenhower   Franklin D Roosevelt  Republicans Frank Knox as secretary of the Navy and Henry Stimson  secretary of war Nobodys got three  said presidential historian Richard Shenkman This is unprecedented Shenkman doesnt think youll be hearing much from the secretaries of transportation or commerce any time soon   those Cabinet secretaries typically take a lower profile   but the appointment of Gates  he said  is highly significant I wouldnt call it tokenism  Shenkman said I think its real He  Obama  is making some kind of an effort there And it comes at very little cost Its a shrewd political move But Terry Sullivan  associate professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  called the Obama appointments little more than political symbolism The real question is not whether its true or false  that Obama has appointed an unprecedented number of Republicans   but what it means  Sullivan said  I dont know what having a bipartisan Cabinet gets you I dont see that it gets you anything Yes  he said  it may mean a few Cabinet members can occasionally give a presidential policy some bipartisan cred Im suggesting this is a very sophisticated political community  Sullivan said Itd be one thing if Obama had appointed the Republican leader of the Senate to a high level Cabinet position That might move things toward some sort of reconciliation government  he said But governing is way more sophisticated than these symbolic gestures Whatever you make of the appointments  Obama is on solid ground when he said his three Republican Cabinet appointments were unprecedented,0,0,864,real

Obama Paid FBI Informant Over  1 MILLION To Do It To Trump!  Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebooks News Feed You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here  Is it true? No The facts behind this claim The FBI informant in question has been reported by the Washington Post and others as American foreign policy academic Stefan Halper According to news reports   the FBI asked Halper to talk to several people involved with the Trump campaign during the summer and fall of 2016 Halper had conversations with Carter Page and George Papadopoulos  then foreign policy advisers to the Trump campaign  and campaign co chair Sam Clovis Early on in special counsel Robert Muellers Russia investigation  Papadopoulos pled guilty to lying to FBI agents about his contacts with Russians in 2016 Trump has said the informant got a massive amount of money  but we dont know if the FBI paid him at all Its simply unknown at this point Where is the money coming from? Heres what the USbreakingnews story got right  Halper received over  1 million to do work for the US government Washingtons spending database shows the government signed four contracts with Halper totalling  1 058 161 between 2012 and 2016 The dates fall during the Obama administration In the key period in 2016   Halper worked on a study of Russian Chinese relationships But the money came from the Defense Departments Office of Net Assessment  not the FBI The Pentagon describes the Office of Net Assessment as an independent organization within the Department of Defense charged with identifying emerging or future threats and opportunities for the United States The USbreakingnews piece gets a bit confused on this point It asks  Why would anyone receive that kind of money   1 058 161  from the DOJ? But the money did not come from the Department of Justice  where the FBI sits It came from the Pentagon The article then asks why someone like Halper would get such money Halpers professional biography gives a few answers Hes professor emeritus at Cambridge University in England where he lectures on international security issues He served as deputy assistant secretary of state for Political Military Affairs in the Reagan administration The headline says Obama had a direct hand in the payments  but it offers no evidence that Obama had anything to do with the contract awards Some money came before Trump announced he was running The articles math is also off About 40 percent of the money was awarded before Trump even got into the race in June 2015 So even if there were a tie between the contracts and Halpers conversations with Trump campaign advisers   and theres zero indication of that    the amount would be less than  1 million The article strings together a handful of facts to gin up a compelling headline  but nothing holds together,3,3,503,fake

And it leaves little doubt about its political intent  as it closes with the line  ohand then you have this clown  who refuses to place his hand on his heart and say the pledge  This is an obvious  and misguided  swipe at Sen Barack Obama  who has frequently been attacked in chain e mails for allegedly refusing to place his hand on his heart when saying the Pledge of Allegiance We at PolitiFact already debunked that myth But here we will check the accuracy of McCains POW anecdote  which was forwarded to us by several PolitiFact readers Heres how the chain e mail reads  in part  One of the men who moved into my  POW  room was a young man named Mike Christian  Mike got himself a bamboo needle Over a period of a couple of months  he created an American flag and sewed on the inside of his shirt Every afternoon  before we had a bowl of soup  we would hang Mikes shirt on the wall of the cell and say the Pledge of Allegiance I know the Pledge of Allegiance may not seem the most important part of our day now  but I can assure you that in that stark cell it was indeed the most important and meaningful event One day the Vietnamese searched our cell  as they did periodically  and discovered Mikes shirt with the flag sewn inside  and removed it That evening they returned  opened the door of the cell  and for the benefit of all of us  beat Mike Christian severely for the next couple of hours Then  they opened the door of the cell and threw him in We cleaned him up as well as we could The cell in which we lived had a concrete slab in the middle on which we slept Four naked light bulbs hung in each corner of the room As I said  we tried to clean up Mike as well as we could After the excitement died down  I looked in the corner of the room  and sitting there beneath that dim light bulb with a piece of red cloth  another shirt and his bamboo needle  was my friend  Mike Christian He was sitting there with his eyes almost shut from the beating he had received  making another American flag He was not making the flag because it made Mike Christian feel better He was making that flag because he knew how important it was to us to be able to pledge our allegiance to our flag and country So the next time you say the Pledge of Allegiance  you must never forget the sacrifice and courage that thousands of Americans have made to build our nation and promote freedom around the world You must remember our duty  our honor  and our country McCain relates this same anecdote in his book  Faith of My Fathers  in nearly identical fashion And the story is backed up by another POW  Leo K Thorsness  albeit with a couple small differences in detail Thorsness was an Air Force fighter pilot who was shot down on his 93rd mission and spent six years as a prisoner of war in Hanoi When people ask if he lived with McCain at the Hanoi Hilton  Thorsness likes to correct  John lived with me I got there first Thorsness  who was awarded the Medal of Honor for valor in the Vietnam War  recalled to PolitiFact the day when Mike Christian found this slimy old rag  an old dirty handkerchief while in the yard outside the cell Thorsness said Christian spent days cleaning up the handkerchief  and used blue ink and ground up red roof tiles for color Then  he took threads from his blanket and sewed on stars with a bamboo needle It took a good bit of imagination to make out that it was an American flag  Thorsness said  but we all knew what it was When Christian finished the flag and showed it to his fellow POWs  Thorsness said  I think every one of us snapped to attention It was a tough group of men  he said  and yet there were very few dry eyes Sometimes  he said  it was hung up on a cell wall and men would salute it and say the Pledge of Allegiance To everyone there  it was very meaningful  he said Christian knew full well that he would eventually be caught and punished  Thorsness said Christian hid the makeshift flag in an extra sleeve of his pajamas But it was discovered by the guards and confiscated during a surprise inspection That night  the guards came for Christian  Thorsness said  and they beat him mercilessly through most of the night They beat the hell out of him But Mike was one tough guy And soon after  Thorsness said  Christian was back at it again making another flag Anyone who witnessed that was moved  Thorsness said It made a lasting impression Christian died in a Virginia home fire in 1983 Thorsness was later elected to the state Senate in Washington in 1988 During a flag amendment debate  Thorsness spoke publicly for the first time about Mike Christians flag Every other senator turned their heads and looked at me  Thorsness said The story was later published in 1992 in Readers Digest Several details in Thorsness account differ from McCains recollection  such as whether the handkerchief was a rag found in the prison yard or  as McCain tells it  part of a care package allowed in by the guards But the stories are substantially the same We rule McCains story True,0,1,990,real

percent of all the electricity needs for the United States of America in a full year,Al Gore startled a Senate committee with an optimistic scheme for harnessing the suns energy The former vice president sketched out the idea at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on climate change where he was the star witness A technology called concentrating solar thermal is now becoming very competitive  Gore said at the Jan 28  2009  hearing  Scientific American pointed out that if we took an area of the Southwestern desert 100 miles on a side  that would be enough  in and of itself  to provide 100 percent of all the electricity needs for the United States of America in a full year In January 2008  Scientific American published an influential article titled A Solar Grand Plan A conservative writer immediately attacked Gores claim The Scientific American article did not say we needed an area 100 miles on each side  which is 10 000 square miles  William Tucker of the American Spectator wrote a day after Gores testimony The article stated  To meet the 2050 projection  of electrical demand   46 000 square miles of land would be needed Gores spokeswoman  Kallee Kreider  said Gore had cited the wrong source   he intended to cite this report from Environment America  an advocacy group that promotes clean energy That report in turn cites the US Energy Department  which does indeed say on this Web page   The solar energy resource in a 100 mile square area of Nevada  otherwise known as 100 miles squared  or 10 000 square miles  could supply the United States with all its electricity using modestly efficient  10   commercial photovoltaic modules Thats a compelling source  but the apparent contradiction cited by Tucker made us wonder So we called two of the authors of the Scientific American piece  James Mason and Ken Zweibel They said that Gore was probably correct  and in fact their article   far from contradicting his claim   contains data that support it Mason and Zweibel said that when they wrote that 46 000 square miles would be needed to meet the electricity demand in 2050  they were assuming electricity would provide a much greater portion of the countrys energy than it does now   including  for example  344 million plug in hybrid vehicles A 10 000 square mile solar plant could well provide todays electricity needs  they said Heres how  dense math ahead  proceed with caution   As graphics accompanying the print version of the Scientific American piece indicate  the sun in parts of the Southwestern United States provides an average of about 65 kilowatt hours per square meter per day of solar radiation Take that 65 kilowatt hours per square meter per day and multiply that by the 365 days in a year and you get 2 372 kilowatt hours per square meter per year Well round it to 2 400 Solar electric systems could   optimistically   convert about 15 percent of that to electricity That comes to 360 kilowatt hours per square meter per year You cant cram solar panels close together  because they would cast shadows on each other For every square meter of solar panel in the southwestern US  you need 25 square meters of space Once you account for that  by dividing 360 by 25   you find each square meter of a solar installation could produce 144 kilowatt hours per year There are 259 billion square meters in 10 000 square miles Multiply that 259 billion by the 144 kilowatt hours that a square meter can produce in a year  and you get 3 729 billion kilowatt hours per year The US consumes about 3 900 billion kilowatt hours of electricity per year  according to the federal Energy Information Administration  So Gores estimate was close enough considering the many uncertainties involved I dont think youve found a serious blunder  said Zweibel  director of the Institute for Analysis of Solar Energy at George Washington University Anywhere from 100 to 150 miles per side will easily produce all the electricity in the United States with any solar technology  said Mason  director of the American Solar Action Plan and the Renewable Energy Research Institute in Farmingdale  NY That said  there are all sorts of reasons why building a 10 000 square mile solar installation would be even more difficult than it sounds For one  we would need a place to store the electricity so that it could be doled out in the dark night hours and on cloudy days Mason and Zweibel suggest using the solar energy to compress air underground in caverns  old mines  aquifers and depleted natural gas wells Then it could be released on demand to turn turbines that would generate electricity Also  we would need a vast new system of transmission lines To pay for that and other necessary improvements  Mason and Zweibel call for  420 billion of government subsidies Even given all the challenges  they  like Gore  argue large scale solar development makes sense when you consider the enormous amounts of land  energy and money we currently use to mine fossil fuels  produce electricity from them and control their pollution Gore didnt exactly tell the whole story  since the 10 000 square mile solar farm would not do the job in and of itself without other infrastructure improvements But he was testifying on the broad issue of climate change  not delivering a lecture on building a solar plant And his misattributing the claim to Scientific American is not a significant inaccuracy  since that article did contain statistics that support the claim,0,0,908,real

Lets examine each half of his comparison Deaths from warfare We found a comprehensive study of war related deaths published by the Congressional Research Service on Feb 26  2010  and we supplemented that with data for deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan using the website icasualtiesorg  Where possible  weve used the broadest definition of death    that is  all war related deaths  not just those that occurred in combat Heres a summary of deaths by major conflict  Another 362 deaths resulted from other conflicts since 1980  such as interventions in Lebanon  Grenada  Panama  Somalia and Haiti  but the number is not large enough to make a difference Gunfire deaths The number of deaths from gunfire is a bit more complicated to total Two Internet accessible data sets from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention allow us to pin down the number of deaths from 1981 to 1998 and from 1999 to 2010 Weve added FBI figures for 2011  and we offer a number for 1968 to 1980 using a conservative estimate of data we found in a graph in this 1994 paper published by the CDC  Here is a summary The figures below refer to total deaths caused by firearms  We should note that these figures refer to all gun fire related deaths    not just homicides  but also suicides and accidental deaths In 2011  about one quarter of firearm related deaths were homicides  according to FBI and CDC data Using total firearm related deaths makes the case against guns more dramatic than just using homicides alone When we rated a previous Facebook post   we lowered an otherwise True claim to Mostly True because it said that nearly 100 000 people get shot every year We found that the number of gun deaths and non fatal injuries added up to 104 852  but we concluded that the term get shot could suggest victims who got shot by someone else rather than by their own hand We dont see a similar problem with the way Shields comment was phrased    namely  died from gunfire,1,0,472,real

By Friday  the number of people who had viewed the video neared half a million In his e mail  Steele said he was so stunned and outraged by the video  he felt the need to circulate it immediately In the video  impressionable youngsters at a public school in New Jersey  most of whom are no more than six or seven years old  have been instructed to sing the praises of Barack Hussein Obama  Steele wrote Friend  this is the type of propaganda you would see in Stalins Russia or Kim Jong Ils North Korea I never thought the day would come when Id see it here in America You can argue whether or not Steele laid the political rhetoric on a little too thick The fact we wanted to check was the question that immediately popped into our head when we saw the video  Did this really happen at a public school? The short answer is yes It happened at B Bernice Young Elementary School in Burlington Township  NJ Thats a public school in the Burlington Township School District In the video  about 18 second graders are in an auditorium singing two songs about Obama Here are some lyrics to the first song  Mm  mmm  mmm! Barack Hussein Obama He said that all must lend a hand To make this country strong again Mmm  mmm  mm! Barack Hussein Obama He said we must be fair today Equal work means equal pay Mmm  mmm  mmm! The second song is set to the tune of The Battle Hymn of the Republic  Hello  Mr President we honor you today! For all your great accomplishments  we all doth say hooray! Hooray  Mr President! Youre number one! The first black American to lead this great nation! Hooray  Mr President we honor your great plans To make this countrys economy No 1 again! According to school district officials  the video was shot in February 2009 and was part of a program to recognize famous and accomplished African Americans during Black History Month There was no intention to indoctrinate children  District Superintendent Christopher Manno said in a released statement There was no political agenda underlying the activity The New Jersey Department of Education also responded via prepared statement The commissioner has directed the superintendent to conduct a thorough review of what happened to ensure students can celebrate the achievements of African Americans during Black History Month without inappropriate partisan politics in the classroom  as well as ensuring the privacy of children is not violated  said Beth Auerswald  a spokeswoman for the district In addition  it is our understanding the teacher in question retired at the end of the last school year Its unclear who wrote the lyrics or shot the video In a note to parents and the media on Sept 24  Superintendent Manno said the recording and distribution of the class activity were unauthorized Fox News reported that the video was originally posted on the Internet by Charisse Carney Nunes  author of the childrens book I Am Barack Obama We sent an e mail to the address on Carney Nunes Web site and received a response that  At this time  Charisse has no comment for press On Friday  Fox News caught up with a few parents in the drop off line at B Bernice Young Elementary School Opinions varied about the appropriateness of the songs Next stop Stalinist Russia? Well leave that to parents  school officials and political pundits to argue about We were checking Steeles comment that impressionable youngsters at a public school in New Jersey  most of whom are no more than 6 or 7 years old  have been instructed to sing the praises of Barack Hussein Obama Yes  they were second graders  which makes them 7 or 8 years old  and therefore  impressionable And the video shows the teacher directing them to sing Most importantly  this was at a public school,3,10,852,real

Fiorina was right that she had more cash on hand than Kasich and Christie combined  they totaled  3 663 459 Here too  thats no great shakes    she still ranks sixth of the eight candidates in cash on hand,1,0,381,real

More and more  it seems In a Twitter message on May 30  2009  Sen John McCain took this poke at the Obama administration  Obama has more czars than the Romanovs   who ruled Russia for 3 centuries Romanovs 18  cyberczar makes 20 First of all  yes  John McCain   the guy criticized during the presidential campaign for being computer illiterate   is tweeting But what about the czars? It sure seems like we keep reading about one czar after another being appointed to oversee the auto industry  the Great Lakes  and the closure of Gitmo  and we wondered  Just how many czars does the Obama administration actually have? First off  the Obama administration doesnt usually call any of these people czars We only found two instances of President Barack Obama using the term  once in an April 15  2009  interview with CNN En Espanol when he talked about the role of his border czar  and once during the campaign when he promised to appoint an autism czar to coordinate a nationwide autism effort  he hasnt yet  And in announcing Obamas nomination of Gil Kerlikowske as director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy  Vice President Joe Biden referred to the position as our nations drug czar Were sure there are more  but the point is that  by and large  you dont often hear the administration talking about its czars In fact  the administration has at times gone to some lengths to avoid the moniker  as was the case in this somewhat humorous  in an inside the Beltway sorta way  exchange between a reporter and White House spokesman Robert Gibbs on June 10  2009  Reporter  On Ken Feinberg  I think that hes maybe the 20th czar type position youve named Gibbs   No  I think the title is special master So who exactly qualifies as a czar? As best we can tell  its whenever someone in the media says so You can identify a guy as Assistant to the President for Science and Technology  Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy  and Co Chair of the Presidents Council of Advisers on Science and Technology  but its a lot easier on everyone to just say Science Czar And Special Master sounds like Richie Richs best friend So the title of czar is largely arbitrary media shorthand for Its this persons job to make sure  blank  goes right And we think everyone can agree that Terrorism Czar sounds way cooler than Deputy National Security Adviser for Homeland Security Below  we have compiled a wildly unscientific list of Obama administration czars But were not the first Talking Points Memo has a slideshow of Obamas czars They count 23  And ForeignPolicycom came up with at least 18 Weve got 28 Some of these czars are carryover positions from previous administrations And czars go way back in presidential history Roosevelt had a slew of so called czars But to the extent that Obama has created a number of new positions to oversee various issues and to cut through bureaucratic red tape  he seems to have a lot more czars than his predecessors Or you could argue that the media has just seized on a new buzzword it likes Were not going to wade into the debate about whether having more czars is a good idea  but Fox ran a story about concerns some lawmakers have with it Were just fact checking McCains claim that Obama has more czars than the Romanovs According to the World Book Encyclopedia   there were  as McCain said  18 Romanov czars  starting with Michael Romanov in 1613 and ending with Nicholas II  who was killed by the Bolsheviks in 1918 As for Obamas czars  weve got 28 who have been referred to as a czar  somewhere Undoubtedly some will take issue with some of the czars on our list  but we think McCain is on solid ground He earns a True,4,0,661,real
